<h1>628 Tips on Making Money on YouTube</h1>
<h2>Starting a Youtube channel</h2>
#1. Don’t be paralyzed by the fear to start out on Youtube. The fastest way to overcome this fear is to actually get started.<br><br><br><br>#2. Choose a niche for your channel and stick to it. Don’t just upload random videos.<br><br><br><br>#3. Don't spend too much time perfecting your channel's avatar, art, or About page when starting out. Since there won't be many viewers initially, it's unlikely that anybody will spend their time examining your channel's design. Invest that time in making another video. You can always improve the look of your channel later when you see some traction.<br><br><br><br>#4. Accept the fact that Youtube is almost never an overnight success. Instead, it’s several months of hard work without seeing much result.<br><br><br><br>#5. Accept the fact that being a youtuber almost never means “just doing whatever you enjoy doing and getting paid for that”. Instead, you will have to be constantly doing what your audience enjoys.<br><br><br><br>#6. If you lose motivation along the way, do the following exercise. Think deeply about why you want to be on YouTube, what you want to achieve, and what your channel's goal is. Write your answers down and put them somewhere you can see them. Whenever you feel lost, scared or unsure, look at your answers and remind yourself why you started.<br><br><br>#7. Don't confuse consistency with quantity and value with quality.<br><br><br><br>#8. Is it too late to start a YouTube channel? No. But it's too late to exploit manipulative techniques trying to make your videos go viral. And it's also too late to become successful churning out low-effort videos. Yes, it's too late to start a Youtube channel now if your intention is to hack the algorithm.<br><br><br><br>#9. A lot of people quit YouTube early because they don't see progress right away.<br><br><br><br>#10. Keep in mind that you're asking other people for their time, which is valuable. You should consider why they should spend five or ten minutes watching your content. It's not about what you deserve, but what you can provide to your audience and what they want and need. Don't feel entitled to views or an audience, because no one is entitled to that. Why should they watch your videos? Working hard doesn't mean you deserve views and subscribers because nobody deserves anything.<br><br><br><br>#11. Audience doesn't know or doesn't care about your problems (not having money to buy a better microphone, not having enough free time for making content). They only care about watching quality content.<br><br><br>#12. Even if you only work on your PC or laptop, always check once in a while how your channel looks on a smartphone screen.<br><br><br>#13. As Markiplier once said, “The hardest truth to understand is that even if your content is the best in the world, no one is looking for it.” It's creators' responsibility  to make their content easier to discover since you can't really expect viewers to search through countless videos and posts looking for yours.<br><br><br>#14. On YouTube, being skilled at something isn't sufficient. You also need to be entertaining.<br><br><br>#15. Why is building a successful YouTube channel so hard? Because you need to be a master of several professions: <br>Writer<br>Teacher<br>Artist  <br>Public Speaker<br>Videographer<br>Editor<br>Graphic Designer<br>Producer<br>Entrepreneur<br>Analyst<br>Craftsperson<br>Marketer<br>Social Media Manager<br>SEO Specialist<br>Brand Manager<br>Community Manager<br>Project Manager<br>It's very hard to be good at all of that from the very start, and it takes time to become good at those.
<h3>Choosing a niche</h3>
#16. Your channel niche must be:<br>1. something you’re passionate about<br>2. something you know a lot about (or willing to learn)<br>3. something that can potentially bring money<br>Youtube is almost never an overnight success. The first several months will be lots of work and not much result. Without passion, you'll give up and quit.<br>Also, channels focusing on daily vlogging or hobbies that are too niche might not have enough potential for monetization.<br><br><br><br>#17. How do you find what you're truly passionate about?<br>You're truly passionate about something if:<br>1. You are willing to do it for free<br>2. You can talk about it for hours<br>3. It has been like this for at least a year (otherwise it might be just a temporary interest in something)<br><br><br><br>#18. When choosing a niche, look for the biggest channels in that niche. If you can’t find a channel that has 50-100k subs, then the niche is probably too small. In a small niche you'll struggle to make enough money.<br><br><br><br>#19. If you make gaming videos and gaming hardware reviews, it's not a good idea to also do fitness videos on the same channel. Your audience would be confused and it would be harder for YouTube to recommend your content to the right viewers. (c, R. Blake's examples, rewritten by ChatGPT)<br><br>I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Here are some improved examples:<br><br>You could do makeup tutorials, beauty product reviews, and skincare routines on the same YouTube channel, but you probably couldn't do that and also do car repair tutorials. The topics are too different and will likely confuse your audience.<br><br>You could do travel vlogs, hotel reviews, and destination guides on the same YouTube channel, but you probably couldn't do that and also do makeup tutorials. The topics are too unrelated and may not appeal to the same audience.<br><br>You could do fashion hauls, clothing reviews, and outfit ideas on the same YouTube channel, but you probably couldn't do that and also do video game let's plays. The topics are too different and may not attract the same viewers.<br><br><br><br>#20. Think about something that excites you so much that you can get others excited about it too. But make sure it's worth their time, not just yours.<br><br><br><br>#21. It's also important to be good at your niche.<br><br><br><br>#22. Niche down. Become the best in your smaller niche and then expand. If you choose a subniche with little competition on YouTube, it's easier to grow quickly. Since there aren't many videos on that topic, people can easily find your content when searching for it. This gives you a better chance to stand out and build a dedicated audience. On the other hand, if you want to explore different topics outside of your niche, it can be tricky. If you're only known for one specific type of content, branching out into other areas becomes challenging.<br><br><br><br>#23. Feel free to create your own niche by making videos about topics that nobody has highlighted before. There's always a risk of failure, but there's always a possibility of success. People have been building successful channels centered around hundreds of crazy things. Here are some examples:<br>- towing cars (Matt's Off‐Road Recovery, 1,480,000 subscribers as of today)<br>- interviewing homeless people<br>- cleaning water ducts<br>- dampster diving<br>- metal detecting<br>- peeling apples<br>- cleaning dirty cars<br>- exploring abandoned locations<br><br><br>#24. If you have unique talents or unique circumstances that not so many people have, build your channel around that. Just being good at something usually is not enough, but if you combine one skill with something else, you'll have an advantage over other youtubers. So, intersection of skills is good.
<h3>Channels to learn from</h3>
#25. agadmator's Chess Channel<br>This channel is really unique and successful. They have over 1 million subscribers and publish videos almost every day, sometimes even multiple times a day. What's fascinating is that despite their simple production style, they still get a good number of views on each video.<br><br>The key to their appeal lies in two things. First, people are drawn to the content because it's engaging and addictive. Even though the videos are just a single take with no editing, viewers love every word the host says and can't resist watching every day.<br><br>Secondly, this channel has tapped into the power of habit. By creating commentary-style content for chess enthusiasts, they've found a dedicated audience that wants to hear their thoughts and insights. This allows them to produce content daily with minimal editing. Even the thumbnails are simple, often featuring just an image of a chessboard with an arrow.<br><br>So, how do they manage to publish so frequently? They find professionally played chess matches, provide commentary, analyze strategies, and walk viewers through the game. All they need is their camera showing them on the side, along with the on-screen elements. With a simple thumbnail, they have a formula for daily uploads.<br><br>In summary, this unique channel has discovered the power of addictive content and habit-building, allowing them to publish daily videos that resonate with their target audience.
<h3>Channel name</h3>
#26. When promoting a personal brand or individual expertise, consider using a channel name consisting of just your first and last name.<br><br><br><br>#27. Consider including the keywords of your niche as part of your channel name. Good real life examples: Learn English with Emma, Yoga with Adriene.<br><br><br><br>#28. If some big creator is already using the same name you were planning to use for your channel, it's best to choose a different name. Otherwise when people search for you, they will likely find that guy instead, and on top of that you might get accused of clickbaiting them.<br><br><br>#29. Make the name of your channel easy to spell.
<h3>Channel art</h3>
#30. If you're building a business-related channel, including a picture of yourself in your channel art is a good idea. It'll help you make a strong connection with your viewers.<br><br><br><br>#31. Channel banner can show no more than five links.<br><br><br>#32. We suggest placing your personal website as the first link because it will be displayed with its full name. Subsequent links will be compressed and displayed with the respective site's logo.
<h3>Profile picture</h3>
#33. Your channel icon is more important than you might think. It shows up in many places on YouTube, such as below videos, in comments, alongside related channels, and in search results. Because it appears in multiple locations, it can be considered the most crucial branding asset on your channel.<br><br><br>#34. If your channel focuses on one or two main characters, using a face as your channel icon is a suitable choice. Faces tend to grab more attention as they feel personal. We naturally connect better with people than with logos.<br><br><br>#35. You might also want to put a logo in your profile picture instead of your face. The profile picture is small, and it's difficult to see a face, but the logo is noticeable.<br><br><br>#36. When choosing your channel icon, keep in mind that it will appear as a small image in most places on YouTube. It can be as small as 32x32 pixels, especially when shown next to comments. Make sure your icon is easily recognizable even at a small size. If you're using a picture of yourself, zoom in on your face, and avoid using tiny fonts that will become unclear when scaled down.
<h3>Channel trailer</h3>
#37. Make a good channel trailer that's usually around one minute long. You can make it up to two minutes, but not any longer than that.<br><br><br><br>#38. It's not mandatory to have a dedicated video as your channel trailer. It's perfectly fine to put one of your regular videos as a trailer. Consider making any of the following videos your channel's trailer:<br>- the video that brings your channel the most subscribers<br>- your most recent video (as additional promotion)<br>- one of your underperforming videos to help it gain more views.<br><br><br>#39. Create a short channel trailer, around 30 seconds to a minute long. Here's what to include:<br>1. Speak directly to your target audience.<br>2. Explain what your channel is about and why it matters.<br>3. Mention your posting schedule.<br>4. End with a strong call-to-action to subscribe.<br><br><br>#40. Use clips from your past videos to make your trailer more engaging.
<h3>"About" section</h3>
#41. Make sure that your "About" page doesn't show the email address linked to your YouTube account and Google AdSense. Otherwise scammers may use that information to target you.<br><br><br><br>#42. When writing the text on the About page, use less of “I” and “me” and more of “you” and “your”.<br>Bad: "Welcome to MY channel! I'M a passionate cook and I'll be sharing MY favorite recipes with you. I started this channel to showcase MY culinary skills and share MY love for cooking with everyone."<br>Good: "Welcome to our channel! We're here to provide YOU with helpful tips and tricks on cooking delicious meals at home. We want to share our passion for food with YOU and help YOU elevate YOUR cooking game."<br><br><br>#43. The text on your 'About' page has to look like it was written by a human, not a robot.<br><br><br>#44. Promote the links to all your other social profiles on the "About" page.
<h3>Other</h3>
#45. What if already have a YouTube channel, but haven't uploaded for years? Now you want to continue. How is it going to be?<br>Over time, people on YouTube come and go, and their interests change. After years of inactivity, most of your audience may have left or developed new interests, leaving only a small percentage still watching your videos. YouTube WILL promote your content to them, but don't expect significant results. (By the way, this could be a good time to consider changing your topic if you want.) Practically, if previously your channel had less than 1,000 subs, then you are now starting pretty much from zero. If you had at least 10K subs, then it's better. An established YouTube channel with subscribers and a history of content is more trusted than a new channel. YouTube gives priority to content from established channels over brand new ones. You will get some decent views. It's not gonna be anywhere near as at your channel's peak, but still much better than starting from zero with a new channel and no subscribers.
<h2>Content strategy</h2>
#46. Roberto Blake recommends making 100 videos in a single topic. He himself made 100 videos on graphic design which brought him 87,000 subscribers. Markiplier made over 100 "Five Nights At Freddy's" videos. PewDiePie's biggest series was "Amnesia". If you create 100 videos on one topic, you can become known for it. When your audience watches one of your videos, they get recommended a dozen others in "suggested", which lets them binge watch your content. This can ultimately help to grow your channel more effectively than just creating one or a few videos.<br><br><br><br>#47. Once you find your niche and learn what works for you, apply the Pareto principle, or 80 / 20 rule, to your content. 80 % of your monthly videos should be focused on topics that you know will perform well based on your audience's preferences. Let yourself experiment with the other 20 %. This won't hurt your channel growth, but at the same time will possibly help you find new working ideas. On top of that, it can prevent burnout, frustration and improve your work/life balance.<br><br><br><br>#48. Stop chasing big youtubers. Trying to emulate big YouTubers without their resources, budget, and experience doesn't make sense because the gap between where they are and where you are is too big.<br><br><br><br>#49. Don't make your content for you. Make it for people like you.<br><br><br><br>#50. Many of you are trying to imitate popular YouTubers, but you need to understand that they're not trying to grow anymore because they already have a big audience. Instead, you should learn from smaller creators who are one step ahead of you. Look at their early work and see what they did to grow. It's better to learn from someone who has 1,000 or 10,000 subscribers in your niche, rather than someone with a million subscribers, because the gap is too big. Learning from someone closer to your level will be more relevant and achievable for you.<br><br><br><br>#51. It's important to realize that most of successful creators spent three to five years or even more to reach 100,000 subscribers. And for those with over a million subscribers, it often took five years or more to get there.<br><br><br><br>#52. A good strategy for gamers is to focus on a specific aspect of the game. For example, if you discover something in the game that a lot of people don't know about, that can be a great way to stand out. For instance, when Bijuu Mike played games like Hello Neighbor or Yandere Simulator on his channel, he often looked for secrets or glitches that he could share with his audience. It could be something as simple as a glitch that he found and showed others.<br><br><br><br>#53. New gamers and gamers in general often believe that playing a popular game is enough to get views, but that's not always true. You need to have an angle or something unique to offer to viewers. Many people don't realize this and just post their gameplay without any thought.<br><br><br><br>#54. My suggestion would be to not begin with vlogging. Instead, focus on creating searchable content that people can discover on their own. This is especially important if you're new to YouTube and haven't posted any videos yet. For instance, people are unlikely to search for something like "Day at the lake with friends".<br><br><br><br>#55. I don't think vlogging is the best way to initially build an audience. My recommendation is to strike a balance. Find what you're passionate about and create content around it, such as reviews, unboxings, and things people are actively searching for. Then, at the end of those videos, you can link to your more personal vlogs. Starting with vlogging can lead to getting stuck in a rut and only reaching a small audience of friends and family. Instead, focus on creating searchable content to reach a wider audience.<br><br><br><br>#56. For Sarah Ditschy going from zero to 4000 subscribers on YouTube was tough, but she found a way to create content that worked for her. Since she loved music, she would attend concerts, film them, and post the footage on YouTube the next day. She titled the videos with the artist's name and the venue, which helped them get a lot of views. This concert footage was what first brought in a couple of hundred subscribers. While people may not have come back to watch her vlogs or other content, it was still encouraging for her to have an audience watching and engaging with her videos.<br><br><br><br>#57. Try different types of content. If you usually make videos on one topic, try making videos on a related topic on a different day than usual. For instance, if you usually make makeup tutorials, choose a day to focus on fashion, hair or nails. If you're a gamer and typically do let's play videos, choose a day of the week for game reviews. Don't be afraid to experiment and see what works best. Posting it on a different day helps you prevent possible protests from your loyal fans expecting to see your usual videos at their usual times.<br><br><br><br>#58. Create not just individual videos but mini-series of videos to give your audience something to binge watch.<br><br><br><br>#59. When you are a beginner, creating videos about yourself such as celebrating subscriber milestones, updates, and behind-the-scenes videos are not worth your time (unless your niche is vlogging). At least, not until you reach a sizable audience that cares about you and not just your content.<br><br><br><br>#60. Focus on growing your Youtube channel instead of getting stuck on what you think your audience want. Always be thinking of new ways to grow your channel instead of being stuck on what you think your existing subscribers want.<br><br><br><br>#61. Make something about your content 1% better every time.<br><br><br><br>#62. The best way to learn how to create good content is to create a lot of content.<br><br><br><br>#63. Learn one new thing every time that you make a video.<br><br><br><br>#64. 75% of all views on YouTube comes from YouTube's recommendations.<br><br><br>#65. YouTube recommends videos in three places: on the Homepage, Trending tab, and in the Suggested videos section. The Trending tab shows popular topics that appeal to a wider audience, while the Homepage and Suggested videos are based on your subscriptions and current video playback.<br><br><br>#66. Focus on what's working well on your YouTube channel and build upon it.<br><br><br>#67. Don't delete your old videos from YouTube, unless they have a strike on them. And absolutely NEVER delete a lot of them at a time. Make them private or unlisted instead.<br><br><br>#68. When confronted with a crucial decision for your channel, like changing your niche or upload interval, here's a foolproof trick to help you make the right choice with unwavering confidence. Grab a sheet of paper, split it vertically into two halves, and jot down all the pros on the right side and cons on the left. Take a moment to carefully review your points, then pick the column you despise the most and... Just go in the OPPOSITE direction.<br><br><br>#69. Do more videos on fewer topics.<br><br><br>#70. Don't do podcasts on your main channel.
<h3>Upload schedule</h3>
#71. Try posting at least one video every week. If you can do more, go for it, but only as long as the quality doesn’t suffer. Generally, it's better to look at your competitors and embrace their style. For example, in gaming niche it's typical to upload daily.<br><br><br>#72. Consistency in upload time isn't as crucial as creating good content. While sticking to a schedule has its benefits such as delivering on viewer expectations and getting into the habit of making videos, it won't affect your views in the long run. Quality should always come first, so if you need more time to perfect a video, take it. Your audience will appreciate it.<br><br><br>#73. Another approach to determining your upload interval: figure out how much time you need to create a quality video and make it your upload interval. If you need 6-8 days to come up with a good video, upload weekly. If it takes you 25 days, upload monthly.<br><br><br>#74. Don't rush and upload lots of content all at once when starting out. Say, if you have 52 videos, your channel will grow more if you keep uploading a video a week all through the year than if you upload a video each day during the first 2 months and only upload sporadically after.<br><br><br><br>#75. When should you upload your videos? The answer is: as long as your audience is awake and available, you're good to go. For most creators, this means publishing their content around 4 or 5 PM Eastern Standard Time.<br><br><br><br>#76. We found that taking a break from YouTube for two weeks won't harm your channel much. However, if you take more than 30 days, it can become more challenging.<br><br><br><br>#77. Content creators who consistently upload one to three high-quality videos per week over a period of several years tend to be more successful than those who do not maintain this level of consistency. By high-quality videos we don't mean filming in 4K and using Hollywood class equipment, but videos that are of value for their audience.<br><br><br><br>#78. It's a popular myth that Youtube stops promoting your last video once you upload your next one.<br><br><br><br>#79. Build a backlog of videos. This ensures that you always have content ready to publish to maintain a regular upload schedule, even if life gets in the way.<br><br><br><br>#80. When you have a significant following on another YouTube channel or other platforms, or if you have a fellow YouTuber who can promote your content, it's advisable not to start your promotional campaign until you have uploaded at least two or three videos to your own channel. By doing this, you offer your potential audience more videos to explore and your channel looks more committed and active.<br><br><br>#81. Here are a few signs that you need to slow down on your publishing schedule:<br>1. You constantly feel that your videos are garbage but you upload them anyway.<br>2. You're not excited about making YouTube videos anymore.<br>3. You feel cramped and as if you have no free time or space to try new ideas or improve something.<br><br><br>#82. What if you need to take a break from your channel? If it's a break of less than a month, there's no need to inform your audience about it. However, if the break will be longer, it's important to let them know in advance. You can do this by making a community post or mentioning it at the end of your latest video. For more significant breaks, consider creating a dedicated video where you explain the reason for your absence and provide an estimated return date. Additionally, staying connected with your audience through other social media platforms during your break is a great idea. This way, you can keep them updated and send them reminders when you're ready to make a comeback.<br><br><br>#83. Is it bad for your channel's health if you take a break from posting videos? Yes. Among other factors, YouTube values the freshness of content. If you're not posting for a while, YouTube will find someone else's more recent content to feed your audience.
<h3>Collaborations</h3>
#84. Collaboration is the second-fastest way to increase your viewership, just behind a viral video.<br><br><br>#85. Only approach the collaborators who align well with your niche. For example, if your channel is about learning foreign languages, don’t collaborate with a cooking channel.<br><br><br>#86. When searching for collaborators, look at channels your size first.<br><br><br>#87. If you want to collaborate with a larger or more successful youtuber, the most effective approach is to reach out to them with a request for an interview.<br><br><br>#88. When reaching out, don’t just copy and paste the same message to all the people on your list. Take some time to watch their content and make a personalized approach.<br><br><br><br>#89. The best way to become a person people want to collaborate with is by offering value to them. Deliver a top-notch interview, advertise their content and projects and then share the interview as much as you can.<br><br><br>#90. Attending events is an excellent way to find potential collaborators. Here is a small list of popular events to get you started: Beautycon, ComicCon, Playlist, Social Media Week, VidCon.<br><br><br><br>#91. Collaborating with people who are much bigger is often challenging. It's not because they care about your subscriber count, but because they may be too busy and already have a lot of friends or collaborators lined up.<br><br><br><br>#92. When asking someone to collaborate, don't make it the first conversation you've ever had with them. You should be genuinely interested in them and have had some prior conversation. Consider collaborating with someone who has fewer subscribers than you but still has an engaged audience. If you collaborate with someone who is much bigger than you, make sure your content is on par with theirs. If your production value or content quality is much lower than theirs, their audience may not be as interested in your content.<br><br><br><br>#93. Many people struggle to find collaborators for their YouTube channels. One reason for this is that they may not have enough content on their channel. Those who have less than 30 videos and are not consistent with their uploads may have trouble convincing other YouTubers to work with them. It is important to have a substantial amount of videos and upload content regularly, at least once a week or even multiple times a week. Other YouTubers may not see the benefit of investing their time in a collaboration with someone who has not put in the effort to build their own channel. It is easier for them to make a video for their own channel and have complete control over the content.<br><br><br><br>#94. If you want to collaborate with other YouTubers, start by reaching out to your friends and people you know. This is a good way to show others the collaboration videos you've done and how awesome they are, which can be your sales pitch for future collaborations.<br><br><br><br>#95. Collaborating with others can help grow your channel because it creates an association between you and the other person. This can lead to related video recommendations and higher search rankings on YouTube. Additionally, you can share each other's content on social media to expand your reach.<br><br><br><br>#96. To find people to collab with, check out your YouTube Dashboard. You can see who your subscribers are and even filter them by their subscriber count. Reach out to people who you think would be a good fit for a collaboration.<br><br><br><br>#97. In your videos or comments, never make fun of other youtubers in a negative way. This can backlash on you.<br><br><br>#98. In YouTube analytics, you can see the "Other videos your audience watched" section. It helps you find creators to collaborate with based on shared viewership.<br><br><br>#99. Collaborating with other YouTube creators is valuable because it allows you to appear in each other's videos and promote each other's channels. This introduces both of you to new subscribers and expands your audience base.<br><br><br>#100. Just appearing in another creator's video and saying you have a YouTube channel won't make people check it out. You need to make them care about you and your content by presenting your unique value. If you can't get them interested, the collaboration was a waste of time.<br><br><br>#101. When reaching out to another creator for a collaboration, make sure to pitch your idea for the video instead of just asking to collab. This is especially important when contacting a bigger channel. Make it easy for them by minimizing their work.<br><br><br>#102. When reaching out to a larger channel that you don't have a prior relationship with, offering unique value can increase your chances of collaboration. If you have skills or talents that the creator doesn't have access to, such as music composition or visual effects, offer to provide something special for their videos. When they see the value you can bring, they'll be more inclined to collaborate and may even give you a shout-out in return.<br><br><br>#103. Collaborations with friends are pure fun.<br><br><br>#104. Don't limit yourself to just collaborations within your niche. Expand beyond and reach related niches. For example, if you're in the gaming niche, collaborate with someone from a tech channel who has knowledge on upgrading PCs.<br><br><br>#105. Pitch your ideas for new content to bigger shows that focus on topics you have expertise in.
<h3>Networking</h3>
#106. If you have friends who are also creators, form a network to share and promote each other's content.<br><br><br><br>#107. Try finding a YouTube buddy to connect with every week. It's super helpful to have someone to share ideas with and get feedback from. Having a friend to collaborate with can make the journey less frustrating since two heads are better than one when it comes to sharing ideas and knowledge.<br><br><br>#108. Many successful YouTube channels started as a group of friends who supported each other. Working together with friends who share your passion makes the journey easier and more enjoyable.<br><br><br>#109. Here are some ideas on how you could grow together as a group:<br>- Host live streams together, taking turns each month to introduce your audiences to each other. Played fun games and invite both sets of viewers to participate.<br>- Feature each other's channels in the end cards of our videos.<br>- Tweet about and comment on each other's videos on YouTube, discussing them in our own content.<br>- Include links to each other's channels in the description text of your videos.<br>- Recommend each other's channels as "Recommended Channels" on your own channels.<br>- Take on challenge videos where you each attempt the same challenge.<br><br><br>#110. Not all of these ideas may be suitable for your specific niche, but the concept remains the same. Seek out other creators and grow together. When one channel gains subscribers, it increases the likelihood that the others will also gain those same subscribers.<br>If you're new to YouTube or don't have any potential collaborators in mind, start by finding a few channels that are in a similar position as you and could be a good match. Begin engaging with these creators regularly by commenting on their videos and replying to their tweets. Build a relationship over time. Once the connection strengthens, consider collaborating on a video or two. Gradually, aim to establish a supportive environment where all of you consistently support each other's channels.<br><br><br>#111. Joining a co-working group can help you maintain consistency in your content creation. It establishes a rhythm for posting videos every week and provides accountability. Additionally, it allows you to share best practices and learn from your peers in the group.
<h3>Trends</h3>
#112. Creating videos about trending topics such as famous people and celebrities can be a great way to attract views and engage with a wider audience. Here are some examples of video ideas that capitalize on the popularity of celebrities and famous people:<br>1. Reacting to the latest celebrity news or gossip<br>2. Creating a makeup or fashion tutorial inspired by a celebrity's look<br>3. Doing a deep dive into the life and career of a famous person<br>4. Reviewing a movie or TV show that stars a popular celebrity<br>5. Collaborating with another YouTuber to do a fun challenge or game inspired by a celebrity<br>6. Creating a parody or satire video that pokes fun at a famous person or their recent actions.<br><br><br>#113. You can also leverage current events that are relevant to your industry.<br>Here are some examples of how to jump on current events in different industries:<br>1. Beauty and Fashion: Create content around red carpet looks and trends from major award shows, such as the Oscars or the Met Gala.<br>2. Technology: Cover major tech conferences and announcements, such as the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) or the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).<br>3. Sports: Discuss major sporting events, such as the Olympics, World Cup, or Super Bowl, and provide analysis or reactions.<br>4. Politics: Discuss and analyze major political events, such as elections, debates, and policy changes.<br>5. Food and Beverage: Cover major food festivals or events, such as the New York City Wine & Food Festival or the World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest.<br><br><br><br>#114. You can also leverage trending topics by creating content around popular songs or moments in pop culture. Here are some practical examples of how YouTubers can cover popular songs or pop culture moments:<br>1. React videos: Create a reaction video to a new music video release or a popular song. Share your thoughts and opinions on the song, the music video, and the artist.<br>2. Dance challenges: Create a dance challenge based on a popular song. Encourage your audience to learn the dance and share their own videos with you.<br>3. Parodies: Create a parody of a popular song or music video. Put your own spin on the lyrics and music video to make it unique and entertaining.<br>4. Lip-sync videos: Create a lip-sync video to a popular song. You can add your own twist to the video by incorporating costumes, props, or a unique setting.<br>5. Reviews: Create a review video of a new album or a popular song. Share your thoughts on the lyrics, the music, and the artist's overall performance.<br>6. Cover songs: Create a cover of a popular song. Put your own spin on the song to make it unique and showcase your own talents.<br>Remember to always respect copyright laws and make sure to properly credit the original artist.<br><br><br>#115. You can also take advantage of trends by featuring popular influencers in your content. Collaborate with an influencer, react to an influencer's content or discuss it in your own video, create content that parodies or satirizes an influencer's style or content. Examples of popular influencers: MrBeast, Shane Dawson, Dude Perfect, Casey Neistat.<br><br><br>#116. Be quick to embrace trends. Don’t wait for a trend to reach its peak.<br><br><br>#117. When hunting for trends, use Reddit, BuzzFeed, Google Trends and your competitors’ channels.<br><br><br><br>#118. Big Youtube channels were able to grow fast because of the Youtube algorithm. When a Youtube reviewer, drama, or news channel reports on a big Youtuber, they sometimes end up with a video related to that Youtuber's videos, which helps them get discovered and gain attention. Many of these channels have changed their original content to talk about big Youtubers because it is a fast way to grow on Youtube.
<h3>Tentpoles</h3>
#119. The tentpole strategy on YouTube means creating content around big events or topics that are relevant to your audience. This could include holidays, seasons, viral videos, popular songs, current movies, and events. By incorporating these trends into your content, you can take advantage of the increased exposure and momentum they bring. The most obvious tentpole events: New Year's Day, Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Easter, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas Day, Cyber Monday, Black Friday, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day. Also 10 examples of major cultural events that can become tentpoles: Super Bowl, Oscars, Grammy Awards, Cannes Film Festival, New York Fashion Week, Coachella, Comic-Con International, Art Basel, World Cup, Burning Man.<br><br><br>#120. When applying the tentpole strategy, be quick. Don’t wait until the Halloween night to upload your Halloween video. Do it at least one or two weeks in advance.<br><br><br>#121. Google Trends is a useful tool for tentpole strategy as it shows when people start searching for holidays, cultural events, and trends, when the searches peak, and when they drop off.
<h3>Searchable content</h3>
#122. As a new content creator, focus on creating search-based content. Make videos that answer questions or talk about popular topics that people are searching for. This makes it more likely that your videos will show up when people search on YouTube or Google. As you get more viewers and subscribers, you can start making different types of videos that your audience will enjoy.<br><br><br>#123. Use the YouTube search bar to find out what people are searching for. As you type in your query, you'll see a list of predictions that reflect what other people are searching for. To reach your target audience, check out these predictions and create content that addresses their queries and interests.<br>Let's say you have a cooking channel and you want to create a new video about making a classic Italian dish. You can use the YouTube search bar to find out what people are searching for related to that dish. When you type "how to make spaghetti carbonara" into the search bar, you might see predictions like "spaghetti carbonara without cream," "spaghetti carbonara with bacon," or "spaghetti carbonara with eggs only."<br>Based on these predictions, you could create a video that addresses each of these variations on the classic dish, providing recipes and cooking tips for each one. By doing this, you're creating content that directly addresses the questions and inquiries that people are already searching for on YouTube, increasing the chances that your videos will be discovered by a wider audience.<br><br><br><br>#124. Youtube search bar allows you to collect hundreds if not thousands of suggestions that are real human searches. If your main keyword is "android", type this word in the search box, type a spacebar and "a". This will give you the following suggestions:<br>android app development<br>android apps<br>android auto<br>android academy ...<br>If you type "android b", you may get this:<br>android broadcast<br>android best games<br>android beam<br>android bluetooth<br>You can continue your research even further, typing "android apps a", "android apps b" etc.<br><br><br>#125. Exploit high-search and low-competition topics. Use TubeBuddy for this.<br><br><br><br>#126. Search is a fantastic tool for new content creators. The reason it's so great is that if your content matches what people are searching for on YouTube, it becomes easier for them to find your videos. And when those people enjoy your content, it helps teach YouTube who your perfect audience is. In short, search helps connect you with the right viewers and improves your chances of success as a content creator.<br><br><br>#127. TubeBuddy shows you the ranking search terms, search volume, competition, and related searches to help you explore further.<br><br><br>#128. If you are a new channel and you are following a searchable content strategy, focus on lower competition keywords because they have more likelyhood of getting picked up more quickly by the algorithm.
<h3>Live streams</h3>
#129. Play games with your audience when doing live streams. Check out the "The Ohana Adventure" channel for inspiration.<br><br><br>#130. Super Chat on YouTube is a feature that lets viewers send money during a live stream or premiere. When someone sends a Super Chat, their message gets highlighted as a pinned comment at the top of a comment feed, making it more noticeable to the content creator and other viewers. It's a way for viewers to show support and get their messages seen during live streams. Super Chats are essentially tips from viewers.<br><br><br>#131. When you enable Super Chat during your live stream, make sure to introduce it to your viewers. Not everyone may be familiar with it, so take a moment to give a brief explanation before starting your live stream.<br><br><br>#132. Thank and acknowledge your Super Chatters during your live stream.<br><br><br>#133. Super Stickers are animated graphics that viewers can purchase to appear in the chat stream. They provide a fun way for viewers to support you and feel a sense of belonging to your community. It's important to note that Stickers are bought separately from Super Chats.<br><br><br>#134. You can set up automatic triggers to respond differently based on the donation tiers. This encourages viewers to donate more for bigger responses. For instance, you can use automatic lights or a confetti cannon that are triggered when you receive a Super Chat, with the intensity depending on the donation amount. To implement these features, you can join IFTTT.com (If This, Then That) and explore its automatic YouTube Super Chat functions.
<h3>Shorts</h3>
#135. YouTube Shorts serve the only purpose - entertainment. If you create a shorter version of a long-form how-to video without making it entertaining, it won't perform well on YouTube.<br><br><br>#136. If you're just starting shorts, upload at least two or more every day consistently. Posting just one per day won't give your channel enough growth.
<h2>Making videos</h2>
#137. Everyone's first video sucks. Yours will too. But that just means that you'll have a chance to learn a lot from it and make your second video better.
<h3>What is a Good Video?</h3>
#138. The best way to go about making a video is:<br>- to have a big idea first<br>- to create a powerful title<br>- plan the possible thumbnail<br>- only start making a video as your last step<br><br><br><br>#139. To make a successful YouTube video, there are four important things you need to have:<br>1. A great concept or idea<br>2. An attention-grabbing opening (hook)<br>3. High-quality content that delivers on your idea<br>4. A quick and smooth transition to your next video
<h3>Equipment and Software</h3>
#140. When it goes for your content, equipment and production quality, always start with only what you have now and improve over time. As a beginner youtuber, using your smartphone camera will be just fine. MrBeast started with a broken smartphone and used it until he got 200,000 subscribers.
<h3>Video duration</h3>
#141. If you're a beginner, start with shorter videos (less than 10 minutes). Many viewers aren't ready to watch a long video without many views coming from a channel with few subscribers.<br><br><br>#142. Your videos should only be as long as necessary. If you can say the same things in a four-minute video instead of a six-minute video, then the perfect video length for that video is four minutes.<br><br><br>#143. If your video tackles a serious topic such as "All you need to know when buying a car" and has a duration of only 10 minutes, it may lead to audience skepticism. For content of this nature, viewers expect a more extensive exploration, so making videos in the range of 20-30 minutes is more appropriate.
<h3>Coming up with Ideas for a Video</h3>
#144. Try asking your audience why they subscribed to you. Their answers could get you some ideas as to the type of content you should be making. You can ask your viewers directly in a video and collect their answers in comments or create a community post.<br><br><br><br>#145. Ask ChatGPT for video ideas. Here's the prompt: Give me 10 good video ideas for a youtube series on [insert niche here]. Each idea has to be unique and valuable to the viewer.<br><br><br><br>#146. Consider using Reddit to get ideas for your videos. Reddit has passionate communities with great conversation threads that can give you ideas for videos people care about. For example, if people are arguing about who would win a fight between two characters, like which Spiderman is better, that is something you could take advantage of. Channels like Death Battle have done this well by looking at things like Goku versus Superman.<br><br><br>#147. Look at your most performing videos for inspirational ideas.<br><br><br><br>#148. Collaborate with your audience by using their content. PewDiePie has a show called Meme Review where he features memes from his PewDiePie subreddit.<br><br><br><br>#149. Don’t set out to start making a video as soon as an idea pops up. Top YouTube creators often come up with multiple video ideas, create thumbnails for them, and then decide which ones are worth making. Oftentimes, only one out of five ideas gets made into a video. Although it may seem like a waste of time, it's actually a great way to make videos of great quality.<br><br><br><br>#150. Ask ChatGPT for some viral video ideas in your niche. It's actually quite good at it.<br><br><br><br>#151. To find popular video ideas in your niche, locate bigger channels that cover topics similar to yours, visit their videos section, sort by "popularity" and check 5-10 most watched videos.<br><br><br><br>#152. Always be making videos about all sorts of new things emerging in your niche: new gadgets, movies, books, video games etc. Be among first to publish those videos.<br><br><br>#153. If your channel is built around your real life business, make a list of 25 questions your customers ask you the most. Sort your list based on the most frequently asked questions. Create content that answers those questions, prioritizing those at the top of the list. (Don't stop at just 25 questions.)<br><br><br>#154. Use Community tab to ask your audience about ideas for upcoming videos.<br><br><br>#155. Controversy can be a powerful tool for viral videos. Creating content that touches on controversial topics tends to generate more views and engagement compared to content that revolves around non-controversial subjects. Controversial videos have the potential to gain momentum as they attract more views, shares, and comments. People are naturally drawn to videos centered around controversial topics, and they are eager to express their opinions on such matters, further contributing to the video's reach and engagement.<br><br><br>#156. Typical controversial topics:<br>- polarizing political figures, ideologies, or current events<br>- racism, gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights<br>- drug use, mental health, or controversial lifestyles<br>- conspiracy theories<br>- celebrity scandals<br><br><br>#157. AnswerThePublic (https://answerthepublic.com) is an online tool that helps content creators, marketers, and SEO professionals come up with content ideas. It shows the questions and phrases people often search for on topics using search engines like Google. It's a useful tool for understanding what people want to know and creating content that matches their interests. It organizes the data in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format. Consider crosschecking the results with TubeBuddy.
<h3>Hook (Video Intro)</h3>
#158. Don’t use any intro logos, don’t say “Hey guys, welcome back to my channel!” Instead, the first seconds of your video need to contain the strongest hook you can come up with. If your logo is so important to you or you have an unbearable urge to tell how your day was, you’ll have a chance to do it once you’re done with the hook.<br><br><br>#159. A hook is a powerful opening of a video that grabs the viewer's attention and makes them want to keep watching. Briefly tell the audience all the coolest things they are about to see while also highlighting some of the best clips from your video. To avoid the "bad movie trailer effect", try teasing the highlights instead of revealing everything at once.<br><br><br>#160. Not just the first seconds, but the first 3 minutes of a 12-15 min video is the most important part of your video. If you hook your audience in the first 3 minutes, it's likely they'll stay for much longer, if not till the end. The rest should still be of high quality, but the first three minutes are the most crucial. (Generally, consider the first 20-25 % of your video the most important.)<br><br><br>#161. Don't have a long talk about what you're going to do in the video, just get to it ASAP.<br><br><br><br>#162. Typically beginner content creators lose 30-50 % of their viewers within the first 30 seconds of the video.<br><br><br><br>#163. The first 8 seconds of your video are crucial to keep viewers engaged before they click off.<br><br><br><br>#164. Ask ChatGPT to improve your existing hook to a video or create a new one.<br><br><br><br>#165. To increase your reach and get more impressions on YouTube, focus on reducing the drop-off rate at the beginning of your content (first 30 seconds) to prevent people from leaving your videos right after clicking on them.<br><br><br><br>#166. Always say your main keywords out loud within the first 15 seconds of your video. Youtube is capable of scanning the audio content of your videos. If it sees the keywords mentioned early on, it will increase the likelihood of your video being discovered when searched by these keywords. Let's say you have a YouTube video about "Healthy Breakfast Recipes." "Healthy Breakfast Recipes" is your keyword, so be sure to say it in your intro.<br><br><br>#167. Consider a 1-second long logo either at the very beginning of a video or after you finish with the hook and the core content starts.<br><br><br>#168. Also consider a transparent logo in the corner of the screen during the beginning of a video.<br><br><br>Here are some ways to hook viewers for different types of content:<br>- How-to video: Begin by showing the end result of what you'll teach.<br>- Episodic content: Start with a quick recap of the previous episode's climax.<br>- News video: Begin by teasing the main story (that is usually the last story in a newsblock)<br>- Comedy video: Open with a punch line or an intriguing question.<br>- Prank video: Start by showing an extreme reaction and a glimpse of the prank.<br><br><br>#169. When creating an intro, make sure it acts as a smooth transition between your opening hook and the main content. Keep it short, ideally between 2 to 3 seconds maximum.<br><br><br>#170. Now that YouTube has a hover play feature, first 15 seconds of your videos become even more important. When you are on desktop and you hover your mouse over a video, it starts playing the beginning of the video instead of a thumbnail. The same happens on mobile, when you pause during scrolling. YouTube automatically selects a clip from the first half of the video to show.<br><br><br>#171. Practice your intro several times before filming.<br><br><br>#172. It's a good idea to pose a question in your intro to make it more intriguing.<br><br><br>#173. At the beginning of a video, it's important to give viewers a reason to listen to you of all youtubers in the same niche. This is especially crucial when your channel is still growing. As you become more popular, your content will speak for itself. It often helps to literally explain to your audience within the first seconds of the video what is so special about your today's content, what kind of research you made to come up with the tips you are about to say and so on.
<h3>Core video</h3>
#174. Your every video has to deliver on the promise made in the title. For example, if your video’s title is "The simplest way to get rid of rodents", and you spend the entire video promoting a 500-dollar mouse trap, don’t expect your audience to be happy about it. Or<br>If you're making a video about creating a 10-story tall ice cream cone, you better show them that ice cream cone as soon as possible. At the very least, show the process of creating it, but definitely show clips of the final product towering above everything else.<br><br><br>#175. Use B-Rolls (extra footage) to keep viewers engaged. Make sure you have a license for each video clip.<br><br><br>#176. Choose video clips that focus specifically on the subject you want to showcase. Avoid using clips that have unnecessary elements or distractions in them. For instance, a close-up clip of a paintbrush stroke is more effective than a wide shot that includes a person painting with the brush.<br><br><br><br>#177. Use humor in your videos if possible, but never force it.<br><br><br><br>#178. When you're a beginner youtuber, talk less about yourself and more about your content. Be authentic, show your personality, but only in the context of your video's topic.<br><br><br><br>#179. Aim at over 50% of average viewer retention in your videos.<br><br><br><br>#180. What's more interesting to us, knowing what you ate today or how you lost 20 pounds in a month through your diet? The latter is more valuable because if we're trying to lose weight, we want to know what worked for you. Similarly, if you're playing a video game, do we want to watch you play or learn how to beat the boss level quickly? You could create a whole YouTube channel focused on beating video game bosses quickly. (c, rewritten by ChatGPT, examples are from R. Blake)<br><br>Sure! Here are some more examples of adding value to your content:<br><br>    Instead of just showing your outfit of the day, you can share tips on how to style the same outfit in different ways, or where to find affordable pieces similar to the ones you're wearing.<br><br>    Rather than just sharing a recipe, you can offer substitutions for certain ingredients to make it vegan or gluten-free, or give advice on how to make it healthier.<br><br>    Instead of just vlogging about your travels, you can provide recommendations for hidden gems in the places you visit, or tips on how to save money on flights and accommodations.<br><br>    Rather than just showing a makeup tutorial, you can share tips on how to make your makeup last all day, or how to create a certain look for different skin tones.<br><br>    Instead of just reviewing a product, you can compare it to similar products on the market, or share hacks on how to use it in different ways.<br><br><br><br>#181. Don't forget about a call to action. Typically, it is:<br>- subscribing to your channel<br>- liking and sharing the video<br>- commenting on the video<br>- visiting your website<br>- following you on social media<br>- subscribing to your newsletter<br><br><br><br>#182. Use clickable cards during a video. A clickable card is a small rectangular pop-up or overlay on the video screen, typically in the corner. They may contain links to related videos, playlists, websites, or even channels of other YouTubers. When clicked, they take users to another video, playlist, or external website. Here is the best strategy:<br>- whenever you mention a related video, show a card with a clickable link to that video<br>- when doing a collaboration with another YouTuber, include a card with a link to their channel<br><br><br>#183. Don't put a clickable card in the first third of your video because you don't want your audience to go check out that link and kill the AVD (average view duration) of this video.<br><br><br>#184. Before creating your video, spend time studying similar videos from popular channels. Take notes on what they cover and how they structure their content. Make sure your video follows a similar format and covers similar topics, while adding your own unique touch.<br><br><br>#185. If you are using blackboard in your videos, learn from Nate of Channel Makers. His blackboard presentations have the most style we have ever seen. Here is a good example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2CbnLeLUoU
<h3>Ending a Video</h3>
#186. When your video is done with the core content, your final goal is to quickly direct the audience to another video on your channel. This can be a follow-up video, a next episode in the series, a deeper research on the same topic or simply a related video. The key task is to invite the viewers to explore your channel thus increasing the average view per viewer (AVPV).<br><br><br>#187. If viewers watch your video and then leave YouTube, it's not good for your video's ranking. Google prefers to keep viewers on their platform, so if your video tends to be the last one viewers watch before leaving, it may be ranked lower in search results.<br><br><br>#188. Don’t give your audience any hints that you’re finishing the video. They will evaporate the moment they sense that you’re done with the main content. Instead, your mission is to catch them while they’re still around and to direct them to your other videos so that they stay on your channel longer. Youtube appreciates that.<br><br><br><br>#189. Consider promoting just one video at your end screen instead of multiple. This usually increases the click-through rate on end screens by eliminating the confusion of choice.<br><br><br><br>#190. Videos that start and end abruptly often have higher viewer retention and fewer drop-offs. Therefore, it's worth considering eliminating long and unnecessary intros and outros from your videos.<br><br><br><br>#191. You can only add an end screen element to the last 20 seconds of a video.<br><br><br>#192. A great strategy to create a data relationship between your videos is by adding your top-performing videos as endscreens and cards on related videos. Even if only a small percentage of viewers click on your recommendations, it signals to the algorithm and helps YouTube find similar viewers to recommend your videos to. If these potential viewers engage with and enjoy your content, YouTube will continue recommending not only that video, but more from your channel.<br><br><br>#193. When using cards and endscreens, select a video from your collection that is likely to interest the viewer. This video is referred to as the "target video." Additionally, utilize the "best for viewer" feature on endscreens, allowing the algorithm to choose a video from your library that it believes the specific viewer is likely to watch. Remember to use this as a supplement, not a replacement, for your target video recommendation. Lastly, in the last 8 to 10 seconds, verbally encourage the viewer to watch the target video with a call to action.<br><br><br>#194. Except the link to a next video, put a subscribe button on your end screen.<br><br><br>#195. Not only can playlists increase exposure in search results, but they also keep viewers engaged by displaying a list of related videos alongside the one they are watching. When sharing a video, use the playlist mode link to encourage viewers to explore more of your content. To do this, go to your playlist, select the desired video, and use the URL from the address bar. Alternatively, when watching the video from your playlist, find the playlist mode URL by clicking on the Share tab below the video.
<h3>Scripts</h3>
#196. An alternative to scripting may be bullet-pointed outline. You can have it on your smartphone.<br><br><br><br>#197. You can even ask ChatGPT to  come up with an entire script for your video based on the outline that you provide it with. Even the outline itself can be written by ChatGPT if you feed it with your video title.
<h3>Filming</h3>
#198. The best way to gain confidence when performing on camera is to practice, to make more videos.<br><br><br><br>#199. Make sure your video background is not distracting and makes sense. The scene sets the tone of the video and many people overlook this. As a bare minimum clean your room.<br><br><br><br>#200. When you mess up a word, snap three times to mark the mistake in the recording. Then, when you look at the audio wave form, you can easily find the mistake and edit it. By doing this, you can save time and avoid searching for errors in the footage repeatedly.<br><br><br><br>#201. To get a blurry background, use a wide aperture lens. It doesn't have to be expensive.<br><br><br><br>#202. Shoot at the highest possible resolution for more options and flexibility when editing, such as cropping and manipulating shots to appear as if taken from multiple camera angles.<br><br><br><br>#203. To make your videos look smooth, shoot at 30 or 60 frames per second. This will give you more realistic and smoother-looking footage.<br><br><br><br>#204. For recording your gameplay, tutorials, instructional videos and simply filming yourself use OBS. It's a free, powerful and highly customizable tool for youtubers of all levels.<br><br><br><br>#205. Teleprompters are a popular tool for content creators on YouTube to help ensure that their messages are conveyed clearly and accurately. However, using a teleprompter can sometimes be obvious to viewers, which can distract from the content of the video. One way some creators attempt to conceal their use of a teleprompter is by moving their head around excessively while speaking. This makes it really difficult for viewers to track the eye movement of the speaker. Do it only if it fits your speaking style though.<br><br><br><br>#206. When filming yourself or recording your voice, smile and use facial expressions. It actually changes the tone of our voice, making it sound more natural, pleasant and friendly.<br><br><br><br>#207. Don't film on your low-energy days.<br><br><br><br>#208. Have ideas for your content well in advance before you start filming, so that you can shoot several sessions back to back when you have the opportunity.<br><br><br><br>#209. If you don't use scripts, prepare ahead of time for what you want to say or do.<br><br><br><br>#210. To manage your time effectively, it's best to record your content when you have a quiet space available, especially if you have kids. Batch-recording during this time can save you time and help you create quality content. You can edit your videos at any time using headphones. When you're feeling exhausted, it's best to film and edit on your days off and handle admin tasks whenever you have free time after work.<br><br><br><br>#211. If you have kids or not many opportunities to film when the house is quiet, it's important to take advantage of those moments. A good idea is to batch-record during those quiet times and edit later, when you have more flexibility to do so with headphones on. This also goes for recording voiceovers.<br><br><br><br>#212. Be sure to be well-rested and focused when shooting or recording.<br><br><br><br>#213. Shaky camera creates a very bad viewer experience. Consider investiing in Gimbal.<br><br><br>#214. Always be looking at the camera when speaking to your audience.<br><br><br>#215. When filming yourself speaking, try to sound like you're having a conversation with someone. It helps you sound more natural and it makes your content feel more relatable and down-to-earth.<br><br><br>#216. When filming, make sure that you are in the centre of your shot.<br><br><br>#217. The rule of thirds is a fundamental guideline in visual composition that many YouTubers use to create visually pleasing and balanced shots in their videos. It involves dividing the frame into a grid of nine equal parts by drawing two horizontal lines and two vertical lines, resulting in four intersection points. The idea is to position key elements of the scene along these lines or at the intersection points to create a more visually appealing composition. Violating this rule creates an awkward look and feel.
<h4>Recording your voice</h4>
#218. Have the microphone as close to your mouth as possible.<br><br><br><br>#219. When you're outdoors or in an environment with a lot of reverb, it's recommended to use a dead cat or windscreen to reduce wind and outside noise interference. This is especially helpful in natural environments where wind and other noises are prevalent. If you're using a microphone indoors, it can also help cut down on noise from things like air conditioners or heaters.<br><br><br><br>#220. When using multiple audio sources or microphones, doing a clap at the beginning of filming can be helpful in syncing audio during post-processing.<br><br><br><br>#221. When speaking in your videos, try to sound as confident as you can.<br><br><br><br>#222. Everybody dislikes the sound of their recorded voice at first. The "trick" is to record your voice anyway and just ignore your initial feelings toward it. It can take a while before you get used to the sound of your voice in a recording, and you even might end up loving it after some time.<br>(There's a physical explanation of this phenomenon. When we speak, we hear our voice not only through the air, but also through the bones in our head, which vibrate and resonate with the sound. This creates a deeper, richer sound than what is actually recorded. When we listen to a recording of our voice, we only hear the sound through the air, and this can be quite different from what we are used to hearing.)<br><br><br><br>#223. Good audio quality is crucial for your recordings. If there is a lot of background noise, consider using a De-Noise filter. If you're dealing with reverb, a De-Reverb filter can help. Most professional editors have these filters available.<br><br><br><br>#224. Before you begin recording your main audio track or talking to the camera, it's a good idea to let the microphone capture some of the room tone and ambient noise for around 5-7 seconds. This will help you isolate background noise during post-processing.<br><br><br><br>#225. When recording a scripted video, practice reading the script out loud at least once before hitting the "Record" button.<br><br><br><br>#226. With scripted videos, if you have access to a teleprompter, use it. This will help you keep your eyes on the camera while delivering the lines<br><br><br><br>#227. When recording audio, never let your input levels peak into the red zone. This indicates that the audio is too loud and may result in clipping. Instead, aim to keep your audio levels in the green or yellow range.<br><br>Clipping is a distortion that occurs when the audio signal exceeds the maximum level that can be accurately captured or reproduced. A recording device is unable to handle the intensity of the sound and so cuts off a signal at its peaks. This results in a distorted and harsh sound quality. Clipping is usually caused by input levels being set too high. Removing heavy clipping from audio is an extremely challenging task. It's much easier to prevent clipping while recording than to fix it later.<br><br><br><br>#228. Don't show too much text on the screen in your videos for the viewers to read. A lot of people in tutorials niche do it because they either can't record a voiceover or don't want to, and it's a terrible idea. Nobody wants to read text walls. Your video's click-off rate will skyrocket, while retention will plummet, and rightfully so. Record a voiceover instead. It's YouTube, not a blog after all.<br><br><br>#229. Smile when recording a voiceover. It may not be visible, but the impact it has is remarkable.
<h3>Editing</h3>
#230. If you do talking head videos, as an alternative to B-rolls, you can use slow horizontal camera pans, slow zoom ins, or jump zoom ins and outs. Also consider changing camera angles or switching from one camera to another in case you have more than one camera.<br><br><br><br>#231. Use info cards in a video at the moments when retention drops.<br><br><br><br>#232. If you use Green screen and color grade your videos, do color grading directly on your green screen footage before you cut it up. Doing it later will be much harder, as color correction will affect the footage on each video layer.<br><br><br><br>#233. When exporting your video from your software video editor, use "H.265". H.265, also known as High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), is a video compression standard that was developed to succeed the widely used H.264/AVC standard. H.265 is considered the best video codec available now because it offers significant improvements in video quality while using less data bandwidth compared to its predecessor.<br><br>One of the key benefits of H.265 is its ability to achieve the same level of video quality as H.264 but at a lower bit rate, resulting in smaller file sizes.<br><br><br><br>#234. Consider filming and exporting in 10bit to maximize video quality.<br><br><br><br>#235. When exporting standard HD 1080 video, choose video bitrate between 12 and 24 Mbps. Set your audio bitrate to 320 kbs.<br><br><br><br>#236. Learn the shortcut commands to the most frequently used operations in your favorite editing software.<br><br><br><br>#237. Do color correction to make sure that your skin tone looks accurate.<br><br><br><br>#238. You may want to prioritize giving your videos a cinematic look. It can make the video more visually appealing and engaging to the audience, add a sense of professionalism and quality to the content, finally it can help the video stand out from other content on the platform.<br><br><br><br>#239. By using presets, you can save time and effort instead of manually adjusting each setting for every video. You can utilize presets to become more efficient in various aspects of video production, such as color grading, audio processing, and video effects. Presets can be applied in video editing software such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, or Davinci Resolve. They can also be used in audio editing software like Adobe Audition or Audacity. Additionally, presets can be used in video effects plugins like Magic Bullet Looks or Red Giant Universe.<br><br><br><br>#240. When it comes to editing, many youtubers are trying to be too fancy too soon. When you're starting out, it's best to stick with basic cuts and transitions.<br><br><br><br>#241. There are tasks that you don't need to watch over when working on videos, such as loading footage or rendering. You can set them up and do something else while they're happening, like editing another video or making a sandwich. It's important to prioritize and take advantage of these passive tasks to be more efficient with your time. Don't waste time watching these background tasks, use that time to do other work.<br><br><br><br>#242. When editing, cut out all the boring and non-essential parts.<br><br><br><br>#243. Use closed‐captioning (CC), or simply put, subtitles. If your videos are scripted, just upload the most recent version of your script to YouTube, and it will do all the rest of the job. Otherwise, when you start seeing some real money from YouTube, consider hiring someone to transcribe your texts. The price typically starts from $1 per minute. closed captions make your video more searchable and discoverable as YouTube's algorithm can index the text.<br><br><br>#244. Captions help optimize videos for search by providing additional context to YouTube and Google. A common misunderstanding is that caption files improve your video's search ranking. While they can influence the keywords your video ranks for, other factors like watch time play a bigger role in determining its position in search results. Should you use captions for your videos? It depends on how much you rely on search. If you're a vlogger, collaborations and engagement matter more than search results. But if you make tutorials, captions can be valuable. Consider the importance of search for your content and decide if captions are worth it. Or you might only add captions to videos that you believe have the potential to be popular.<br><br><br><br>#245. When starting an editing project, first import all your existing footage on the timeline and put it in the right order. Then cut out all the parts that scream "You don't want me here!". Rinse, repeat and cut out all other parts that might seem necessary at first, but aren't needed anyway. Only then apply B-Rolls, extra sounds, music, titles, transitions and filters.<br><br><br>#246. When editing educational content, show most important phrases from what you say on the screen. It makes your videos less boring and helps your audience remember the most important bits.<br><br><br>#247. Free images for your videos:<br>FreeImages / MorgueFile
<h4>Software</h4>
#248. Use the following video editing apps:<br>Android: InShot<br>iPhone/iPad: LumaFusion<br>Apple: iMovie<br>Windows: Adobe Premiere Pro<br><br><br><br>#249. DaVinci Resolve is the best free professional video editor.<br><br><br><br>#250. When starting out with DaVinci Resolve, you only need to know the following:<br>- how to create a new project<br>- how to import your video file, additional footage, sounds and images into the project<br>- moving, deleting, splitting clips on the timeline<br>- changing duration of clips<br>- layers<br>- adding music and sounds<br>- adjusting volume<br>- fade-ins/fade-outs<br>- inserting an overlay text<br>- dynamic zoom<br>- transitions between clips<br>- rendering the final video<br>This video will give you all this information: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEksPdEc7aI.<br><br><br>#251. If you own a Mac, you already have iMovie at your fingertips. It's a powerful editing application that comes preinstalled. It's highly recommended for YouTube video editing because it's user-friendly and has everything you need for entry-level video editing.<br><br><br>#252. Final Cut Pro is a big step up from iMovie. It has a similar user interface and allows you to import your iMovie projects seamlessly.
<h4>Sound</h4>
#253. Viewers don't like bad audio in videos. They can tolerate some issues with lighting and camera focus, but bad audio is a big problem. "Bad audio" in YouTube videos refers to audio that is of poor quality, such as being too quiet, too loud, muffled, distorted, or containing distracting background noise.<br><br><br><br>#254. For sound editing, use Audacity. It's free, multi-platform, easy to use, has wide range of features (sound effects, noise recuction, sound equalization) and supports plugins and extensions.<br><br><br><br>#255. If you hear too much reverb when recording your voice, be sure to fix it. Having good quality sound in a Youtube video is crucial. Consider the following options:<br>- try finding a better placement for your microphone, keep it closer to your mouth<br>- use a dynamic microphone, they are designed to capture only the sound directly in front of them and avoid picking up background noise<br>- apply acoustic treatment to your room<br>- install Krisp to kill reverb on the fly<br>- cancel the reverb in post-production. We've seen the best results from iZotope RX software. Lots of folks seem to be happy with Adobe's AI-powered audio enhancer tool (https://podcast.adobe.com/enhance).<br><br><br>#256. If you're looking to improve the sound quality in your studio or room, there's a simple trick you can try. Take a blanket from your bed or borrow one from someone else's room. Place it on the floor or drape it over nearby objects like doors or furniture. These soft surfaces will help reduce reflections and echo in the room. While it may not completely eliminate sound issues, it can significantly reduce the amount of echo, making your recordings or videos sound better.<br><br><br>#257. If you're experiencing echo issues during voiceovers in your videos, here's a simple yet effective solution. Grab a blanket and trust me on this one. Talk into your microphone while being underneath the blanket. By doing this, you limit the distance that sound waves travel, as they get caught in the blanket instead of bouncing off the walls. It might make you look and feel a bit silly, but your audio will come out sounding great without any echo problems.
<h3>Music</h3>
#258. Don't make the background music too loud.
<h4>Sources of music</h4>
#259. YouTube provides the YouTube Audio Library, where creators can freely download music and sound effects for their videos. These tracks are copyright-safe for use on YouTube, so you won't face Content ID claims or affect monetization. It's important to note that some tracks require attribution, which means you need to give written credit in your video's description. These tracks are marked with a "CC" icon and you can easily copy the attribution text from the icon to paste it into your description.<br><br><br><br>#260. If you're part of the YouTube Partner Program, you can access Creator Music. It combines the YouTube Audio Library tracks and sound effects with a library of mainstream music that you can use in your videos without risking your monetization. When you filter by price, you can find free tracks. Icons indicate the usage terms for songs, such as buying a license upfront or sharing revenue with the artist. You can see if a track isn't available for licensing or revenue sharing, and using it may have restrictions on visibility or monetization of your video. You can download a track to test it with your content before purchasing a license.<br><br><br><br>#261. Epidemic Sound offers over 40,000 tracks and over 90,000 sound effects.<br><br><br><br>#262. Search "creative commons music" on Youtube. This will give you a list of playlists with tracks that you can use for your monetized videos. The download link is usually provided. You'll need to credit the author in the description to your video. Also the "Creator Mix" channel.<br><br><br>#263. Here are some sources of music for your videos: Youtube audio library (the safest and free option), NCS (NoCopyrightSounds), Epidemic Sound, Scott Buckley, Uppbeat, AudioHero, Artlist, Lickd, stream beats by harris heller, Tunetank, Soundstripe.<br><br>Also check out this link for other sources: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qrw3Zm-IhXfk0Xyvvqj6ro8K-t3tzMYsJwuG_1D7Zqo/edit#gid=0<br><br><br>#264. Some of the royalty free music services are generally okay to use, but I want to caution you about potential issues. Licenses can change unexpectedly. Let's say you use a royalty-free music track or sound effect in your video, thinking it's safe because it was free. Well, what if the license later changes? The company behind that track could suddenly copyright claim many YouTube videos that used it, including yours. Not only does this negatively impact your content, but they can also claim a portion or all of the revenue generated from that track, even though it was originally supposed to be free. It's unfortunate, but these predatory practices happen frequently.
<h4>Copyright</h4>
#265. Please mind that using someone else's "copyright free" music comes with a risk because the owners can still copyright it in the future, which may result in a copyright strike on your videos.<br><br><br><br>#266. Simply giving credit to the copyright owner or using phrases like "All rights and credit for the music go to the original artist/creator", "I do not own the rights to the music in this video" or "No copyright infringement intended. All music rights belong to their respective owners." does not grant you permission to use copyrighted work. It can lead to your video being blocked, made ineligible for monetization or taken down completely.<br><br><br><br>#267. If you use someone else's copyrighted content in your video, like music playing in the background or even singing or playing part of a song on an instrument, you might still face copyright claims and your video could be taken down.<br><br><br><br>#268. Using any amount of someone else's copyrighted work, even a few seconds, without permission puts you at risk of receiving a claim or takedown. Just because similar videos exist on the site doesn't mean you have the right to post that content.<br><br><br>#269. If you record gaming content, be careful with copyrighted songs in video games. Game background music is usually fine, but if there is a licensed track like "Blinding Lights" by The Weeknd "Grand Theft Auto V", it needs to be cut, muted, or replaced.
<h3>Lighting</h3>
#270. If you're on a tight budget or prefer not to spend any money, you can still achieve good lighting for your YouTube videos using natural light. The best light source is sunlight, and it's completely free. Position yourself as close as you can to a window to make the most of the natural light. Ensure that your camera is also angled in a way that allows enough light to come in. Avoid placing the camera directly in front of the window, as it can make the lighting appear flat. Instead, position yourself and the camera at a slight angle, around 45 degrees, similar to professional lighting setups. This will create more depth and make your videos look better, even without expensive lighting equipment.<br><br><br>#271. Three-point lighting is a popular lighting setup used by YouTubers and other content creators to achieve well-balanced and professional-looking lighting in their videos. It involves using three primary light sources strategically positioned around the subject to create depth, dimension, and control over shadows. Here's a breakdown of the three lights involved:<br><br>    Key Light: The key light is the primary light source and serves as the main source of illumination. It is typically positioned at a 45-degree angle to one side of the subject, slightly above eye level. This light casts the most significant light and shadows on the subject, adding depth and shaping their features. It should be the brightest light in the setup.<br><br>    Fill Light: The fill light is used to soften the shadows created by the key light. It is placed on the opposite side of the key light, also at a 45-degree angle. The intensity of the fill light is typically lower than that of the key light, providing a more balanced and natural lighting appearance. It helps reduce harsh shadows and provides overall illumination to fill in the darker areas.<br><br>    Backlight (or Rim Light): The backlight, also known as the rim light, is positioned behind the subject, aimed towards them from the back. It helps separate the subject from the background by creating a subtle glow or highlight along the edges of the subject. This light adds depth and visual separation, giving a sense of dimension and making the subject stand out from the background.<br><br><br>#272. Many YouTubers use blue light in their videos for a few reasons:<br>    Blue light creates a cool and modern aesthetic that appeals to viewers.<br>    Blue light contrasts skin tone, it literally makes skin pop up.<br>Blue lighting is often associated with technology and gaming. Many YouTubers in these niches use blue light to enhance the theme and create a futuristic or high-tech atmosphere that resonates with their content.
<h3>Thumbnails</h3>
#273. The thumbnail is the first thing potential viewers see, and it greatly influences whether they click to watch your video.<br><br><br>#274. While a beginner, use Canva for thumbnails. It's a free tool that has tons of customizable templates for you to choose from.<br><br><br><br>#275. When you feel like you're outgrowing Canva, switch to Photoshop (or Gimp, which is the best free alternative to Photoshop).<br><br><br>#276. Adobe Photoshop is the most well-known application for making thumbnails. One of the reasons it's so popular is that there are tons of tutorials on anything related to this program. It's disadvantages are steep learning curve and monthly subscription.<br><br><br>#277. If you struggle coming up with effective thumbnails, take inspiration from the bigger players in your niche.<br><br><br><br>#278. Do A/B testing of your thumbnails. TubeBuddy is the most recommended tool for this.<br><br><br>#279. To run an A/B test (or a split test), select a video from your library and add a slightly different secondary thumbnail, such as changing the background color. Avoid using a completely different variation for accurate results. Once the test is complete, analyze the performance of each thumbnail and pay attention to the traffic sources. Take your time to interpret the numbers correctly as they can be misleading at a quick glance. Use your analytical skills and investigate further.<br><br><br>#280. Compare your video's performance to your usual results to see if changes are needed. Try changing the thumbnail first and monitor the numbers. If it doesn't improve, tweak the title and check again. Keep swapping thumbnails until you find one that works. It may take a few tries, but eventually, you'll see the numbers go up.<br><br><br>#281. Go back and update your underperforming thumbnails. It's never too late to do it, but the first 24-72 hours are the most crucial.<br><br><br><br>#282. Use Photopea as a free web-based alternative to Photoshop and Gimp. Photopea has many features similar to Adobe Photoshop, such as layers, filters, and adjustment tools, but can be accessed through a web browser without requiring installation or a subscription fee.<br><br><br><br>#283. If you're unsure about which colors to combine and don't want to learn color theory or use a color wheel, there's a simple trick you can use. Look up different sports teams and their uniforms, and pay attention to their color pairings. You can steal those color pairings to know what colors to put together.<br><br><br><br>#284. When creating a thumbnail, don't put anything important into the lower right corner, as it's where YouTube puts the timestamp.<br><br><br><br>#285. Consider putting your face in your thumbnails. YouTube says that thumbnails with a face statistically get more clicks.<br><br><br><br>#286. If you have a logo, put in in your thumbnail.<br><br><br><br>#287. Remember, thumbnails can be changed whenever you want. You can modify and adjust them if you feel the need to do so. You may also want to update some of your older thumbnails at some point.<br><br><br><br>#288. Use short and simple text on your thumbnail, ideally 1-5 words.<br><br><br><br>#289. Consider scaling your thumbnails down to 120x90 and check if they still look good.<br><br><br><br>#290. Successful thumbnails have something intriguing about them, they should create curiosity.<br><br><br><br>#291. If you have many videos on different topics, make thumbnails for each topic look similar. Aim at consistency at layout, background color, font type, font style and font color. This helps viewers quickly tell which videos are part of a specific topic or series. Having many thumbnails on a subject shows viewers that you cover this topic in-depth. Also reusing a template instead of creating each thumbnail from scratch saves time and effort.<br><br><br><br>#292. Use different colors for the background of thumbnails belonging to different topics. If your niche is flowers, use a soft pink background color for the thumbnails in the roses playlist and natural green for the videos in the wildflowers playlist.<br><br><br><br>#293. Avoid using a white background for your thumbnails because the YouTube website itself has a white background.<br><br><br>#294. According to data, the best thumbnails usually have an object and a person with complex emotions on the face.<br><br><br>#295. To draw the viewer's attention to a particular person or object in the thumbnail, utilize red arrows, circles, hand gestures, and emojis.<br><br><br>#296. Show action in your thumbnails whenever you can because people love it.<br><br><br><br>#297. To see how your thumbnail compares to others, take a screenshot of search results and use Photoshop to add your thumbnail. This helps you understand how viewers would perceive your thumbnail.<br><br><br><br>#298. Have two or three different versions of each thumbnail concept to test and easily change if your click-through rate (CTR) is not good. While an overkill for a absolute beginner youtuber, this tip becomes more relevant as your channel grows and you see at least 500 average views on your videos.<br><br><br>#299. If a video doesn't perform well within the first two hours after the upload, consider changing the thumbnail to a more clickable one. Only do it if your average view count for one video within the first month is at least 500.<br><br><br>#300. Even if you only work on your PC or laptop, always check once in a while how all your thumbnails look on a smartphone screen.<br><br><br>#301. Use no more than 3 colors for your text.<br><br><br>#302. Another good strategy is repeating the title of the video in a thumbnail using shorter text. A real life example: video title is "How To Build A Business That Works | Brian Tracy #GENIUS", the thumbnail features the text "Build a business that works"
<h3>Titles</h3>
#303. According to Netflix data, after grabbing the viewer's attention with the thumbnail, you only have 1.8 seconds to make an impression with your title.<br><br><br>#304. For a title to work, the idea behind the video has to be strong. No title can save a trashy video.<br><br><br>#305. Don't make your video titles too long. The absolute limit is 100 characters, but on mobile Youtube only shows 50 characters. So use 50 characters or less.<br><br><br>#306. If you can shorten your title without ruining the meaning, do it.<br>Examples:<br>Bad: "10 Amazing and Unbelievable Life Hacks You Must Try at Home Right Now for Easier Everyday Living"<br>Good: "10 Easy Life Hacks for Everyday Living"<br><br><br><br>#307. A video title with the keyword at the beginning is more relevant than when it's at the end<br>Bad title: "How to Make a Moist Chocolate Cake from Scratch | Delicious Chocolate Cake Recipe"<br>Good: "Delicious Chocolate Cake Recipe | How to Make a Moist Chocolate Cake from Scratch"<br>The main keyword is "chocolate cake recipe". Bad title has it at the end, good title has it at the beginning.<br><br><br><br>#308. Look at your competitors' channels for successful title ideas.<br><br><br>#309. When deciding on a title, choose which traffic source you are primarily targeting. There are three types of titles you can come up with.<br>Topic: Healthy Breakfast Ideas<br>    Title for Better Discoverability through search: "How to Make Healthy Breakfasts: Easy Recipes for a Nutritious Start"<br>    Title for Broader Audience (browser traffic, suggested videos): "Delicious and Nutritious: 6 Easy Breakfast Ideas for a Healthy Start"<br>    Title for Current Audience (people who know you and your channel well): "My Favorite Breakfast Recipe: A Nutritious Twist for Dedicated Foodies"<br><br><br>#310. Embrace clickbait titles because guess what? It works. It was considered very annoying several years ago, but now it's pretty much widely accepted. "Clickbait" is fine as long as the title doesn't lie about the content of the video. Stay away from truly cringy clickbait though. Bad clickbait titles: "You won't believe what happens next!", "AMAZING trick to get rich quick!", "Breaking news: [Celebrity name] is dead!". Good clickbait titles: "I tried a 24-hour no sleep challenge and this is what happened!", "10 easy tips to improve your cooking skills", "Learning French in 30 days: My progress and tips". Why are clickbait titles even so popular? Clickbait titles are popular because they leverage curiosity and the desire for instant gratification. People are naturally drawn to intriguing or provocative headlines, even if they may not always deliver on their promises. <br><br><br><br>#311. How can you come up with a good clickbait title? Learn from your biggest competitors, most likely they are using it. Or ask ChatGPT for help, by giving it the following command: "Generate a clickbait title for my YouTube video based on this title: [insert title here]".<br><br><br><br>#312. If you have a video with a current year in title, like "The best way to start a YouTube channel in 2023" and this video performs well, consider renaming it to "The best way to start a YouTube channel in 2024" once the year 2024 begins. It's also wise not to actually pronounce the word "2023" in your video as this is gonna be much harder to update later.<br><br><br><br>#313. Titles that start with "How to" simply do not work on YouTube anymore. You need to come up with a much catchier title to grab audience's attention.<br><br><br><br>#314. Ask ChatGPT to help you make better titles for your videos. Here is an example for you. The prompt: "My youtube video title is "How to start a YouTube channel in 2023". Give me 5 more clickable variations of this title." These are possible generated results:<br>1. "10 Steps to Starting a Successful YouTube Channel in 2023"<br>2. "The Ultimate Guide to Launching Your YouTube Channel in 2023"<br>3. "New to YouTube? Here's How to Get Started in 2023"<br>4. "2023 YouTube Channel Creation: Tips and Tricks for Beginners"<br>5. "From Zero to YouTube Hero: Starting Your Channel in 2023"<br>Looks much more appealing, doesn't it?<br><br><br><br>#315. You can use ChatGPT to improve the titles of your previous under-performing videos. Mr. Beast frequently updates the titles and thumbnails of his old videos to appeal to his current audience.<br><br><br><br>#316. If you are in the letsplay niche and you name your video like "Let's Play: Game X - Part 12", that's the most terrible thing you can do. Nobody watches that.<br><br><br><br>#317. If you have a new channel or are having trouble getting views, pick one search term and use it exactly as your video title. For example, "Easy Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe". (Also be sure to include "Easy Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe" into the first sentence of the description and say it in the first 15 seconds of the video.)<br><br><br><br>#318. Relevance is higher when the video title matches the exact keyword phrase in the same order as the viewer typed it.<br><br>For example, the video titled "10 Essential Beginner Photography Tips for Stunning Photos" is an exact match for the keyword query "beginner photography tips".<br><br>On the other hand, the video titled "10 Photography Tips for Beginners" doesn't have an exact match, making it less relevant according to YouTube's search algorithm.
<h4>Effective title strategies</h4>
#319. Use questions in your titles. Examples:<br>"How to Start a Successful YouTube Channel?"<br>"Which Workout Routine Is Most Effective for Weight Loss?"<br>"Why Should You Invest in Stocks and How to Get Started?"<br><br><br>#320. Use numbers in your titles. People love numbers. Examples:<br>"5 Must-Visit Tourist Attractions in Paris, France"<br>"Top 15 Fashion Trends of the Year You Need to Try"<br>"8 Proven Strategies to Save Money and Build Wealth"<br><br><br>#321. When you address the viewer in the video title, it makes them feel like the video was made just for them, increasing the likelihood of a click.<br>Examples:<br>"A Beginner's Guide to Growing Your Own Vegetable Garden"<br>"Unlock Your Creativity: Try These 5 Drawing Techniques"<br>"Get Fit at Home: Exercises You Can Do Anytime, Anywhere"<br><br><br>#322. Highlight a problem, let the viewers know that you have the solution, but don't put it in title.<br>Examples:<br>"Struggling to Organize Your Home? Here's How to Declutter and Create a Serene Space"<br>"Can't Stay Focused While Studying? This Is How to Improve Your Concentration and Ace Your Exams"<br><br><br>#323. Use these words in your titles to make them stand out: amazing, best, crazy, easy, faster, insane, now, quick, simple, step by step, ultimate, worst.<br><br><br>#324. Capitalize important words in your titles (or even entire titles).<br>Examples:<br>"TOP 10 TRAVEL DESTINATIONS You Can't Miss in 2022!"<br>"ULTIMATE GUIDE to SEO: BOOST Your Website Traffic and RANK HIGHER!"<br>"COOK LIKE A CHEF: AMAZING RECIPES for Gourmet Home Cooking!"<br><br><br>#325. In the video title, focus on the viewers' interests and give them a compelling reason to care. Instead of simply describing the video's content, explain why it is relevant and valuable to them.<br>Title example 1 (Adheres to the tip):<br>"5 Effective Workout Tips for Busy Professionals to Stay Fit and Healthy"<br>Title example 2 (Doesn't adhere to the tip):<br>"Basic Workout Techniques for Beginners"
<h3>Descriptions</h3>
#326. The best example of effective and nice-looking description to a video that we've seen so far is Roberto Blake's videos. Here's a link for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40RjvxRX1H8<br><br><br><br>#327. You can easily update descriptions to hundreds of videos at once using TubeBuddy's find and replace tool. This allows to add or change links to your own website or Amazon Affiliate, among other things.<br><br><br><br>#328. If you're trying to rank your video for an exact search phrase, include this phrase in the first 10 words of the description. Fo example, if your target search phrase is "weight loss exercises for beginners", the first sentence of desription might look like this: "In this video, we share effective weight loss exercises for beginners that will help you kickstart your fitness journey."<br><br><br><br>#329. Don't spend too much time polishing your video descriptions. The impact of video descriptions on YouTube rankings is much smaller compared to the importance of Watch Time metrics.<br><br><br>#330. Avoid using the same description repeatedly for multiple videos. It may be seen as duplicate content by the YouTube algorithm.<br><br><br>#331. The "above the fold" section of the description is crucial since it's the first thing viewers see and what the algorithm prioritizes. The "above the fold" part of descriptions for YouTube videos typically allows around 100 to 150 characters before it gets cut off. In other words, usually it's the first sentence.<br><br><br>#332. Avoid listing or repeating keywords in an unnatural way in your video description. Google is smart and can understand content at a basic level. Writing keyword blocks is unnecessary and goes against YouTube's rules, which could lead to strikes on your channel. Instead, focus on writing descriptions for real people while keeping a few keywords in mind.<br><br><br><br>#333. After you're done with the text concerning the actual video, consider including a reminder to subscribe.<br><br><br>#334. Customize your channel's default settings with the text you want to include at the end of all your videos. This should include your value proposition, a reminder to subscribe, your posting schedule, and links to your website and social profiles, as well as affiliate links, your courses (if you have any), free downloadable resources etc.
<h3>Tags</h3>
#335. Use relevant tags for your videos. While tags are not as crucial as your title, thumbnail, and description, they still provide value, especially if people often misspell certain words. Include your primary and secondary keywords, along with other relevant terms, in your tags. Make sure to keep your tag length within 300 characters. TubeBuddy is a helpful tool that suggests relevant tags based on your video's content.
<h3>Chapters</h3>
#336. YouTube video chapters are like bookmarks in a book. They help divide a video into different sections or topics. You'll see these chapters as clickable timestamps in the video's progress bar. By clicking on a chapter, you can jump straight to that specific part of the video.<br><br><br>#337. Don't bother with chapters in your videos. They aren't that effective and even sometimes can be detrimental for the average view duration. There's a trend for using chapters less now. However, you still might want to use them in longer videos that serve as guides of some sort.<br><br><br>#338. If you're making a 10 things... or 5 things... video and creating chapters, don't give away those things in your chapter titles.
<h3>Uploading videos</h3>
#339. Always upload at 1080p.<br><br><br><br>#340. Youtube absolutely doesn't care how you name a video file or a thumbnail file that you upload. Don't even bother putting your best keywords in the titles of those filenames, it won't help you promote your content.
<h3>Productivity</h3>
#341. Start with simple videos. If you have a lot of other things going on in your life, like a job, family, or school, it's better to create simple videos than to not create videos at all. Start with "talking head" videos and build up gradually, as you become more comfortable with content creation and have more time to dedicate to it.<br><br><br>#342. Try to come up with the title and thumbnail idea before you start filming and not the other way around.<br><br><br><br>#343. Always be batch producing content. When you’re filming, shoot two videos at once. When making thumbnails, do it for several videos. This is the biggest productivity advice we can give you.<br><br><br>#344. With each new video that you make, improve something.<br><br><br><br>#345. Don't confuse consistency with quantity and value with quality.<br><br><br><br>#346. If you have a regular nine-to-five job, filming or editing your content right after work may not be the best option for you, as you may not have the necessary mental and emotional energy. During this time, it's better to spend your energy on smaller tasks that take only 45 minutes to an hour, such as creating thumbnails, conducting research, or handling administrative work. When you're tired after work, you may not be able to make good judgments on your edits or give your best performance on camera.<br><br><br><br>#347. If you have kids or not many opportunities to film when the house is quiet, it's important to take advantage of those moments. A good idea is to batch-record during those quiet times and edit later, when you have more flexibility to do so with headphones on. This also goes for recording voiceovers.<br><br><br><br>#348. To manage your time effectively, it's best to record your content when you have a quiet space available, especially if you have kids. Batch-recording during this time can save you time and help you create quality content. You can edit your videos at any time using headphones. When you're feeling exhausted, it's best to film and edit on your days off and handle admin tasks whenever you have free time after work.<br><br><br><br>#349. Keep your assets organized. Assets are any media files such as images, videos, audio clips, graphics, pre-made intro and outro clips and more that you use to make videos. This can be achieved by creating clear and organized folder structures, naming files consistently, and using tags and keywords to quickly filter and locate specific assets.<br><br><br><br>#350. Make something about your content 1% better every time.<br><br><br><br>#351. The best way to learn how to create good content is to create a lot of content.<br><br><br><br>#352. Learn one new thing every time that you make a video.<br><br><br><br>#353. You can't film when there's a lot of noise around you. However, you can perfectly edit in any possibly environment.<br><br><br><br>#354. Backup everything.<br><br><br><br>#355. If you're busy with school, work, or family, start your channel with easy and simple content. Create as much content as you can and do your best until you have more time to dedicate to it. Also, wait until you know it's worth putting in more effort. Consider this as your foundation.<br><br><br><br>#356. Don't aim for perfection, as it can be harmful. Just getting a task done is more important than doing it perfectly. Don't let the pursuit of perfection hinder your progress.<br><br><br><br>#357. Make sure that when you're creating your videos, you're in a good state both physically and mentally. Ensure that you're not hungry or thirsty and that you have plenty of energy. This will translate to your audience and impact how they perceive you.<br><br><br><br>#358. Don't let YouTube dominate your life. Don't neglect your family, work and school because of your passion for making content on Youtube. If you have difficulty prioritizing, set a goal to only spend a set amount of hours weekly on your channel.<br><br><br><br>#359. When you start making enough money to outsource some of the tasks, <br>prioritize outsourcing those that:<br>- you passionately hate<br>- you aren't good at<br>For most content creators it's either making thumbnails or editing.<br><br><br>#360. When researching competitor channels, always sort videos by popularity and focus on top 5 or ten of the most popular ones.<br><br><br>#361. Create a group of trusted peers in your field. Meet regularly online or in person to discuss YouTube topics, share ideas, and support each other. Good places to start are:<br>- Facebook<br>- the "NewTubers" subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/NewTubers/)<br><br><br>#362. Always have a stock of at least one video at hand in case life comes up and you need to take a break from your channel.<br><br><br>#363. To avoid total demotivation, take a planned break from YouTube every year.
<h3>Analytics</h3>
#364. For beginner YouTubers, it is common to spend excessive time obsessing over their statistics. Even PewDiePie has mentioned in the past that when he started out on YouTube, he would spend hours refreshing the page to see the updated view count. However, this is counterproductive, consumes a significant amount of time and energy and may lead to demotivation and burnout. Allocate specific times to review your analytics. Set aside dedicated periods, such as once a week or once a month, to analyze your statistics.<br><br><br>#365. On average, subscribers tend to watch 25% longer than non-subscribers.<br><br><br><br>#366. If you've been making videos every day for months but not seeing any progress, you're doing something wrong and you need to figure out what it is.<br><br><br>#367. Why do videos sometimes explode well after publishing? These are the main factors:<br>1. External influence: somebody might have shared this video with an active community on Reddit or Facebook.<br>2. Seasonality. A video about a ski resort published in summer will probably flatline until next winter when the skiing season starts.<br>3. The algorithm finally finding the right audience for the video.<br>4. Growth of the channel giving the algorithm the opportunity to test the video on new audience.<br><br><br>#368. If your channel is not attracting new viewers and experiencing growth, it's going downhill on YouTube. In the Analytics tab, find the "Videos growing your channel" section. If you don't have at least a few videos with "moderate" to "high" "new viewers who returned" ratio, it means your channel is not growing, and that means trouble.<br><br><br>#369. Another sign of a channel that develops in the right direction is when you as a content creator constantly test and apply new ideas and approaches. And yet another one is that you always have many new promising ideas for your videos.<br><br><br>#370. In retention graph, if you see a drop that soon goes back up, it means people are skipping ahead parts of your video.
<h4>Getting feedback</h4>
#371. Checking how well your YouTube channel is doing is important. Even more so is doing it right. The wrong way to do it is hit the "NewTubers" subreddit and write a post: "Hey guys. I started my channel a week ago. I have 2 videos, 27 views and 3 subs. How am I doing?" In most cases you just get shoulder tapped and encouraged to continue your grind. Here's the right way to do it:<br>Take some time and find 5 or more active YouTube channels that do absolutely the same thing as you're doing and that have give or take the same number of subscribers. Every 2-4 weeks compare your channel's performance against theirs. If you're gaining more average views and subscribers than them, you're fine. If you're the outsider, learn from them like crazy.<br><br><br><br>#372. Never ask the following people for feedback:<br>- your mom (unless she's also a content creator)<br>- your friends who know nothing about your niche<br>- those who always pat you on the back and encourage no matter what<br>- those who bash your every single video without providing any reasons behind their criticism<br>Remember, not any feedback is good.<br><br><br><br>#373. Only another content creator or someone from your audience can provide you with an honest feedback about your videos.<br><br><br>#374. Join a relevant Facebook group for feedback. Avoid groups with empty praise or baseless criticism.<br><br><br>#375. You can try asking for feedback about your videos on Reddit. The most fitting subreddits are "NewTubers", "Youtubers" and "Letsplay". "Letsplay" and "NewTubers" have a dedicated "Feedback Friday" event, "Youtubers" has "Monthly Show-Off Thread". Additionally, you can make a post asking for feedback anytime. Be prepared for a dose of back tapping, and deep advice are rarely given.<br><br><br>#376. Some channels focusing on helping others to grow on YouTube host regular free channel review live streams. Channel reviews rarely include video reviews though. Generally, few channels do free video reviews now. Many channels have regulat live streams where you can ask questions. The questions asked there are often confusing and don't provide enough information, making it hard for the hosts to give a useful answer.
<h4>Metrics</h4>
#377. The most important metrics on YouTube are:<br>Click‐through rate (CTR)<br>Impressions<br>Average view duration (AVD)<br>Average percent viewed (APV)<br>Watch time and views<br>Average views per viewer (AVPV)<br><br><br><br>#378. When examining the analytics of your videos, pay most attention to:<br>- click-through rate (CTR)<br>- retention rate.<br>CTR measures how many viewers click on your video's thumbnail or title and start watching the video, compared to how many times the video has been shown to viewers.<br>If your video has a high CTR, YouTube is more likely to recommend it to new potential viewers. If your video has a weak title, topic, or thumbnail, it can result in a lower CTR, which reduces the chances of your video's success.<br>To get more viewers, it's crucial to create an attractive and attention-grabbing topic, title, and thumbnail for your video. If these elements fail to pique the viewers' interest, they are less likely to click on your video, and as a result, YouTube will not recommend your video to other potential viewers. <br>Retention rate measures how long viewers watch your videos.<br><br><br><br>#379. When it comes to your video stats, it may seem strange that better videos often have lower stats. The reason for this is that as a video performs better, it reaches a larger audience with different viewing experiences. This can affect various stats.<br><br>For example, if your video has very low impressions, it's easier to achieve a high click-through rate (10-15%) because the few people who see it are more likely to click. Similarly, if a video has only 10 views but receives positive feedback, it's a good sign that it might attract more views in the future.<br><br>However, things get more complex when your videos start reaching a broader audience. Different viewers interact with your content in various ways, which can affect your stats in unpredictable ways. In your analytics, you may notice that your best-performing videos have lower retention or click-through rates. This can be confusing if you don't understand how YouTube works.<br><br>To summarize, the issue isn't that your content isn't good enough or that YouTube won't show it to others based on your stats alone. The problem is that your videos weren't competitive enough at that point to be shown to a larger audience. For instance, I have a video on my channel with under a minute of watch time but millions of views. However, as you scale up your views, the same principles apply. The better you can maintain high stats as your videos reach more people, the better the audience response will be.<br><br><br><br>#380. If you notice an increase in returning viewers and an increase in average views per viewer, it means that your channel is healthy and experiencing growth.<br><br><br>#381. On YouTube, an "impression" means the number of times your video thumbnail and title are shown to people on the platform. It shows how many times your video has been seen by potential viewers. It doesn't matter whether the viewer actually clicks on the video or watches it. The more YouTube shows your thumbnails and titles to the audience, the more impressions you get. Your video can appear on different parts of YouTube, such as the Homepage, Search results, Subscription feed, or Suggested feed.<br><br><br>#382. For an impression to be counted on YouTube, the viewer needs to spend at least one second looking at the video's title and thumbnail. If they quickly skip past it in less than a second, it won't be considered as an impression.<br><br><br>#383. When your video gets more views on YouTube, the percentage of viewers who click on it (CTR) may decrease. Don't be alarmed by this because it means your video is being shown to a wider audience outside of your usual viewers.<br><br><br>#384. Look for other channels sending views to your videos.  In the Analytics section, click on "Analytics" in the left sidebar and then select "Traffic Source" from the submenu. Explore the External Sources section: Scroll down the Traffic Source report page until you find the "External Sources" section. This section displays the sources from which viewers are coming to your videos. Look for Referring Channels: Within the External Sources section, you'll find a breakdown of the channels that are referring traffic to your videos. These are the channels that are driving views to your content.<br>By analyzing the Referring Channels data, you can identify which channels are sending views to your videos. You can then visit those channels to understand the relationship and potential opportunities for collaboration or content improvement.<br>Please note that YouTube Analytics provides data on external sources based on the available information and metrics. It may not capture all channels or sources accurately, but it can still provide valuable insights into your video's performance and traffic sources. You might discover successful topics related to your brand that you should start covering.<br><br><br>#385. Check the audience retention scores for your videos. If you notice a sudden drop in the analytics graph, it means you didn't create enough intrigue or answer the viewer's "hook" questions. If you see a gradual decline, it means you initially caught their interest, but didn't provide the expected value throughout the content. Or it's just the result of a misleading title.<br><br><br>#386. Watch time is how long people spend watching your videos. When viewers spend more time watching your content, it tells YouTube that your videos are important and should be shown to other viewers who have similar tastes.<br><br><br>#387. The initial views and watch time that your videos receive in the first 48 hours are crucial for your channel's success on YouTube. This is evident when you check your real-time analytics on the YouTube dashboard, as it only counts the first 48 hours.
<h2>Promoting videos</h2>
#388. Don't buy ads from Youtube to promote your videos. Even though they often work, the effect is never long-term and they are never worth the money you'll spend on them. It's only recommended to buy advertising when you're selling a product, offering a service, or have built your brand to a certain level where it makes sense.<br><br><br>#389. Unless you're an established brand with a budget, organic growth is your best friend. Organic means no paid solutions (ads) and no black seo schemes (spinning views with bots, stealing other people's content etc.).<br><br><br><br>#390. Don’t waste time promoting your channel on other social media. Trying to send traffic from Instagram, Facebook or TikTok to Youtube is plain ineffective. Even if some users click on your Youtube videos, they only usually watch several seconds of the content which ruins average view duration (AVD) and results in Youtube recommending your videos much less.<br><br><br><br>#391. However, if you ALREADY HAVE MANY followers on other social networks, it wouldn't hurt to encourage them to subscribe to your channel as well. However, be prepared for the conversion rate between different platforms to be quite modest: if a few percent of your audience clicks the link and subscribes, that's already a good result.<br><br><br>#392. If you actively comment on Reddit, be sure to link your Youtube channel in your profile.<br><br><br><br>#393. Talk to people that are interested in the same thing that you are. Don't ask them what they think about your last video. Ask them what they think about the things you said in your last video. You can find those people on Reddit, Twitter, Facebook.<br><br><br><br>#394. When promoting your videos on Facebook or Reddit, ask the administrator if you can share a video occasionally.<br><br><br><br>#395. According to a study by pex.com, most YouTube videos (90%) receive fewer than 1,000 views, while only a tiny fraction (less than 1%) of videos generate more than 80% of the total views.<br><br><br><br>#396. When a user watches an "iPhone Hacks" video from your channel, your other videos that have the keyword "iPhone" in their titles are highly likely to show up in the "Suggested videos" section.<br><br><br><br>#397. Suggested Videos can greatly increase your views and make your channel more engaging for viewers. If you manage to dominate your own videos in the Suggested Videos section, you can boost your overall Watch Time and create a captivating channel experience.<br><br><br>#398. Review older relevant content from bigger influencers and ask them or pay them to include endscreen elements, links, and shout-outs directing their audience to your content. When loyal viewers watch the influencer's content to the end and they promote your content or product, you have a higher chance of achieving your goals as they come through YouTube's ecosystem naturally.<br><br><br><br>#399. There are two ways to promote your videos. The first approach is the traditional method: create a video, upload it to your channel, and then try to get it shared by various blogs and websites. This can be effective, but it often requires building relationships with the site owners. It's usually better to start with smaller blogs and websites, gradually growing your channel and gaining attention from bigger sites over time.<br><br>Don't overlook other online communities like Facebook groups, pages, Google+ communities, and forums. Join a few communities that interest you and reach out to the admins to introduce yourself. Building relationships within these tight-knit communities can be beneficial.<br><br><br><br>#400. Another approach is to combine seeding and collaboration. Instead of simply hoping for shares, reach out to the author of a blog or the administrator of an online community with a video idea that would be valuable to their audience. If they show interest, quickly create the video and share the YouTube link with them. If the video is good, they will likely post it for you, leveraging their reputation within the community. This method is more effective because you know in advance that the targeted community is interested, and it allows the author or administrator to feel involved in the process if they choose to be. It saves time compared to creating videos without a guaranteed audience.<br><br><br><br>#401. Start by finding relevant Facebook groups and communities that align with your content. Join these groups and actively engage with the members. When appropriate and allowed within the group's guidelines, share one of your videos with the community. You can also consider privately sharing your video with an administrator or group leader. If they find it valuable, they may share it for you.<br>Additionally, search the web for blogs and online forums that might be interested in your videos. Subscribe to these platforms and stay updated with their content. Contribute value to these communities by leaving comments, making posts, sharing their content, and, of course, sharing your own videos with them over time. Building relationships and adding value to these online communities can help increase exposure for your videos.<br><br><br><br>#402. As your channel grows in size, it becomes beneficial to create a website and collect email addresses from your audience for sending out regular newsletters, either on a weekly or monthly basis. One effective strategy to obtain email addresses is by offering something of value for free, such as an eBook, a course, or a template.<br><br><br>#403. However, it's important to avoid immediately selling through your newsletter. While it may be tempting to promote and push your products or services right away, building trust with your audience takes time. It requires a period of nurturing and establishing a connection with your audience before they are receptive to your sales messages. People need time to familiarize themselves with your brand and build a level of trust before making purchasing decisions.<br><br><br>#404. If you send out newsletters, promote your new videos there.<br><br><br>#405. Ask your audience to like your video somewhere in the middle of the video, in between two valuable segments. Do it in a quick and fun way.
<h3>YouTube algorithm</h3>
#406. The YouTube algorithm or simply "the algorithm" is the system that decides which content to recommend and show to users. It takes into account their preferences, viewing history, and engagement patterns.<br><br><br><br>#407. As a small YouTuber, you should know a simplified version of the algorithm. There are three important things that even Mr. Beast focuses on: getting people to click on a video, getting them to watch it as long as possible, and getting them to watch more of your videos.<br><br><br><br>#408. YouTube recommends videos based on what you watch, how long you watch it, and how often you watch it, not just that video, but the topic too. The algorithm is driven by YouTube's topics and classifiers, and it's all based on your behavior. This is evident when you look at your YouTube homepage, which shows videos from the last 100 things you watched, whether or not you are subscribed to the channel. Even if you haven't subscribed to a channel, if you watch a few of their videos in a row or a longer video, YouTube will likely recommend more of their content to you.<br><br><br><br>#409. Let me simplify that for you. If you watch a lot of different YouTubers and subscribe to various channels, the ones you watch most often will get recommended to you. For instance, if you watch Philip DeFranco every day, YouTube will suggest more of his videos to you. However, if you don't watch a channel for some time, YouTube may stop recommending it to you.<br><br><br><br>#410. YouTube's algorithm doesn't search for viewers for your videos. It uses different methods to predict which videos you might watch based on your watch history, search history, viewing habits, how long you watch a video, and your interaction with specific creators. YouTube's algorithm also considers the viewing habits of people like you, who watch similar types of videos and are subscribed to similar channels. This profiling determines what videos you see on the homepage, in suggested videos, and below videos on mobile devices. Subscribers don't play a big role in this process, and user preferences dominate the platform. Many popular YouTubers claim that subscriber counts don't matter because their views and videos aren't reaching their subscribers.<br><br><br><br>#411. The YouTube algorithm looks at how many views a video gets in the first 24 to 72 hours. So if a video gets more views in the first few days, YouTube sees it as engaging and ranks it higher in search results.<br><br><br><br>#412. Many people think that YouTube promotes specific content and creators, but this is completely inaccurate. The truth is that YouTube operates more as a pull system than a push system. In other words, YouTube prioritizes the viewers rather than the content creators.<br><br>Here's how it works: When you publish a video on YouTube, if there are viewers on the platform who might be interested in your content, YouTube will "pull" that content and present it to those viewers. YouTube doesn't actively promote every video that is published. So, it's not a situation where you upload a video and YouTube immediately promotes it to everyone.<br><br>Moreover, there is no favoritism on YouTube. The algorithm itself doesn't have preferences or opinions about our content. Instead, it relies on how users interact with the content. This is crucial to understand, especially for new content creators. The algorithm follows the audience's response.<br><br>If people respond positively to your content, YouTube will show it to more people. On the other hand, if people aren't engaging with your content, such as not clicking on it or not continuing to watch after clicking, YouTube will prioritize videos that are getting better activity. This means it's vital to focus on creating a positive viewer experience because there are no tricks or shortcuts to deceive the YouTube algorithm.<br><br><br><br>#413. Youtube's goal is to find the right video for a viewer, not to find viewers for your videos.<br><br><br>#414. In 2005-2012, before the YouTube algorithm was established, videos were ranked based on view count. A video with a high number of views would be recommended to all users, regardless of their interest in the content. This system was easily manipulated. Creators would refresh the page repeatedly to inflate the view count, and some would use clickbait titles to attract more clicks.<br><br>2012 - 2015: Watch Time<br>During this period, watch time played a significant role in YouTube's algorithm. It was a crucial factor in determining video rankings on the platform.<br>YouTube aimed to keep users engaged and on the site for longer durations. Videos with longer watch times were favored and featured on the home page. This indicated to YouTube that the content was valuable and provided a positive user experience.<br>Creators adapted to this change by creating either very long videos or extremely short ones that captured viewers' attention from start to finish. In response, YouTube started considering overall viewer satisfaction, taking into account metrics such as likes, dislikes, surveys, and time spent on each video.<br><br>2016: "Deep Learning"<br>In 2016, YouTube faced the challenge of recommending the most suitable and engaging videos from its vast library to individual users. To tackle this, YouTube implemented "deep learning" techniques, which involved analyzing users' viewing history to generate and rank video recommendations based on their preferences.<br>The process involves two main steps: candidate generation and ranking. Firstly, YouTube looks at the user's history to create a pool of potential videos (candidates). These candidates then go through the ranking process to determine the most relevant and personalized recommendations for the user.<br><br><br>#415. YouTube wants all creators to succeed because it benefits the platform, but they don't prioritize the success of any specific creator.
<h3>Engaging with the audience</h3>
#416. If possible, come up with a special name for your community. PewDiePie calls his fans “bros”. Gary Vaynerchuk calls his audience “Vayniacks”. Your viewers will love it.<br><br><br><br>#417. Ask your viewers for ideas for your next video, create content based on their suggestions, and give them a shoutout at the beginning of the video by naming actual names. Nothing will make your audience feel more encouraged, surprised and happy than this.<br><br><br>#418. Youtube is great for content but not so much for communication with fans. So choose ONE other platform to keep in touch with your fans.<br><br><br>#419. Ask your viewers to share your videos on social media.<br><br><br>#420. YouTube is not the best platform for a deeper communication with your audience. To address this, it's recommended to create profiles on other platforms. Some people recommend promoting only two social networks to avoid overwhelming viewers with choices. However, not all viewers prefer the same platforms, so initially, provide all the options. As time goes on, see which platforms generate the most engagement and abandon the accounts that are not being utilized.<br><br><br>#421. If you're overwhelmed with the messages from your community on Twitter, Facebook or Discord, set a time limit and respond to as many comments as possible within that timeframe.<br><br><br>#422. Many famous youtubers use rituals to help build their communities. Rituals create a sense of regularity and predictability, foster a sense of community among viewers, they create a deeper connection between the YouTuber and their audience and, finally, make those youtubers more recognizable.<br>Famous rituals include:<br>- Casey Neistat's "Mail Time" (opening fan mail and reacting to it)<br>- PewDiePie's "Bro Fist" (raising his fist towards the camera)<br>- MrBeast's Charity Videos<br>- Markiplier's The "Warfstache" Character and "Subscribe to Markiplier" Ending<br>- Dream's Mystery Merch Drops (unannounced limited-edition merchandise sales)<br><br><br><br>#423. One highly effective approach to encourage viewer interaction is by asking a question. Some youtubers ask a question at the end of every video. When you ask a question, it's important to convey genuine interest in the viewer's response. One effective way to demonstrate this is by personally replying to each comment with a thoughtful reply.<br>Furthermore, it's beneficial to avoid asking yes or no questions as they don't foster meaningful conversations. Instead, ask open-ended and opinion-based questions that encourage viewers to share their stories and perspectives.<br>Lastly, be mindful not to overwhelm your audience with too many questions. Asking about multiple topics can confuse people and make it difficult for them to decide where to start their discussion.<br><br><br>#424. Having fans is important, but having superfans is absolutely important.<br><br><br>#425. Creating superfans is the most important thing for your channel and brand. It's even more crucial than getting more views, subscribers or sales. When you focus on superfans, you naturally attract more views, subscribers or sales.<br><br><br>#426. With just one thousand true fans who are willing to buy everything you produce, each contributing $100 in annual profit, you can build a six-figure business. (A concept introduced by Kevin Kelly and greatly expanded by Pat Flynn, the author of "Superfans".)
<h3>Comments</h3>
#427. Always ask people to leave comments on your videos.<br><br><br>#428. When your channel is small, respond to every single comment on your videos. Most of you won't receive many comments anyway. As you grow bigger, be sure to at least answer every question that people ask you in comments. Even when you become famous, consider answering personally to everyone who leaves a meaningful comment in the first few hours after the video is published. Every person that you reply to with more than just "thanks" could become your potential subscriber.<br><br><br><br>#429. Don’t give too much weight to comments under your videos such as “Nice video”, “It was really helpful”, “You deserve more subs”. Everybody gets them and they mean nothing. Only trust the objective data from Youtube analytics. Your video is nice only if it receives a nice amount of views. Your content was only then really helpful to people if your video showed a retention of 50% or higher. You only deserve more subs if you’re getting a lot of subs.<br><br><br><br>#430. To fight scammers, consider blocking links from your comment section.<br><br><br><br>#431. Put banned words into your community settings.<br><br><br><br>#432. Don't spam other people's videos with comments asking them to come to your channel, watch your videos, or do sub for sub. This will only turn people off, and many content creators usually ban and block those people from commenting again.<br><br><br><br>#433. When dealing with negative people like trolls and haters, your best options are: ignore them, block them, ban them, report them, or delete their comments.<br><br><br><br>#434. If someone keeps harassing you, report them so they won't bother you anymore and won't bother others either.<br><br><br><br>#435. Get into the habit of regularly mentioning and taking into account the comments your audience leaves. If they offer a suggestion or advice (like what game you should play next) and it seems reasonable to you, give it a try. If they request more or less of something specific, take their feedback into consideration and act accordingly. PewDiePie took it to next level by fulfilling his viewers' request to dress up as a unicorn or tape salad to his face.<br><br><br>#436. There is no direct evidence to suggest that the number of comments alone has a direct impact on the ranking of a video on YouTube. However, comments can contribute to engagement, which is an important metric for YouTube's algorithm. Higher engagement can indirectly signal to YouTube that the video is valuable and relevant to the audience, potentially influencing its ranking.<br><br><br>#437. It's a good practice to respond to the initial comments soon after publishing a video. By doing so, when other viewers visit the video, they will see that you actively engage with comments. This demonstrates that you value and listen to your audience, creating a more personal connection beyond being just a face in a video.<br><br><br>#438. After responding to a few initial comments, take a break from the video and focus on other tasks. Return later in the day or the following morning to catch up on the remaining comments. This approach allows you to engage early in the conversation without letting comments consume your entire day.<br><br><br>#439. Set a time limit of about an hour each day to reply to comments, and prioritize responding to comments on recent videos.<br><br><br>#440. You may try promoting your channel on other people's videos. Pick a channel in the same niche as yours. It's better if it's an active channel with lots of comments under videos. Don't pick their old videos. Wait until they release a new one and try to be the first to comment. Your comment needs to be relevant to the topic of the video otherwise it may get blocked. At the same time, your comment has to spark a desire in other commenters to visit your channel. That is the real art, because if you promote yourself too openly, people will just skip you.<br><br><br>#441. Block links in your comments to avoid spam.
<h3>Community tab</h3>
#442. Once you hit 500 subscribers, you get access to the Community tab.<br><br><br>#443. If you can't see the Community tab, it's because YouTube categorizes your content for kids or you haven't reached the minimum number of subscribers.<br><br><br><br>#444. Be sure to promote your most profitable videos and playlists in the Community tab on your channel.<br><br><br><br>#445. Community tab is a great opportunity to promote your older videos, merchandise, or other products you sell.<br><br><br>#446. Use Community tab to ask your audience about ideas for upcoming videos.<br><br><br>#447. Request some popular creators to share your videos in their Community tab. (This tips highlights the importance of building connections with fellow creators in your niche.)<br><br><br>#448. Also use Community tab to promote your new content.<br><br><br>#449. Use your Community tab to share videos that may not have performed as well as expected.
<h3>Subscribers</h3>
#450. YouTube only sends your video to people who have notifications on and your most engaged subscribers. If viewers skip or don't watch your videos multiple times, YouTube stops showing them your content, even if they're subscribed to your channel. This doesn't mean you're a bad creator, as even popular channels can have low views on some videos due to audience preferences and the YouTube algorithm. For example, some channels with millions of subscribers in the business niche may only get a few thousand views per video, but this is normal. YouTube wants to show viewers the content they're most likely to watch, as it generates more revenue.<br><br><br><br>#451. Get more views, and you will get more subscribers.<br><br><br><br>#452. If your Youtube channel is focused on a specific topic, like a Pokemon Go channel, most of your subscribers will watch your videos and likely subscribe. That's why many people create niche channels on Youtube.<br><br><br><br>#453. Many creators don't realize that views are the key to gaining subscribers. If your videos aren't getting enough views, it's impossible to get more subscribers. That's why it's important to focus on maximizing views on your videos.<br><br><br><br>#454. When starting out at zero subscribers, suppress your desire to ask all your family, friends and colleagues to become your first followers. Believe me, your mom is not your target audience. (Unless she actually is into gameplay or whatever you're doing!) If your subscribers aren't interested in your videos, they won't watch them. YouTube will see low click-through rates and assume the videos aren't good, which will harm their visibility. Even if they watch a bit to support you, low view retention can also hurt your video.<br><br><br><br>#455. Don't do sub4sub. Sub4Sub means subscribing to someone's channel in exchange for them subscribing to yours. This method is a quick way to gain new subscribers and isn't against Youtube's policies. On the other hand, this won't make your channel truly grow, as you end up with people who don't watch your videos. Overusing this method leads to a false sense of success.<br><br><br>#456. Definitely stay away from third-party sites that sell or exchange subscribers. Everything in the previous tip applies here, but this actually IS against Youtube's rules and is easily detectable. This can get your channel terminated.<br><br><br>#457. Always ask your viewers to subscribe to your channel. Statistically, content creators who remind their audience to subscribe in every video tend to have larger subscriber base.<br><br><br><br>#458. Don’t ask your viewers to subscribe at the very beginning of your videos. Don’t just say: “Please subscribe to my channel”. Only ask to subscribe once your video has provided your audience with enough value to justify subscription. <br><br><br>#459. Always tell your viewers what they’re going to get out of subscription. Example: “If you found this video helpful, remember to subscribe to my channel so you can see all of my new recipe videos every week.” Another good point is to tell your audience how much their subscription means to you: "If you enjoy my content and want to see more, I would be incredibly grateful if you could hit that subscribe button." You can also stress the amount of work that goes into your content.<br><br><br>#460. Thank your viewers for following you. In the course of your video say something like: "Thanks a lot for 16 subscribers. You're amazing!"<br><br><br><br><br>#461. If you've already grown several hundred subscribers and your goal is to grow your subscriber base even more, find your top 10 videos that you brought you the most subscribers and make more videos like that. Also promote those most performing in terms of subscribers videos in your other videos. Use end screens and the Community tab.<br><br><br><br>#462. When someone subscribes to your YouTube channel, it doesn't mean that they will immediately have your every new video recommended to them on the YouTube homepage. It's more complicated than this and it really depends on how much of your content they watch and if they watch it to completion. YouTube wants people to stay on their platform for as long as possible. If your subscribers aren't really invested in your channel, YouTube would rather recommennd them other videos on the homepage. It hasn't worked that way since at least 2015.<br><br><br><br>#463. Don't stress out over losing subscribers all of a sudden for no apparent reason. YouTube periodically removes inactive, closed, bot and spam accounts. This can lead to a decrease in the total number of your subscribers.<br><br><br><br>#464. Be creative like MrBeats when asking to subscribe. In almost every video, he leaves a special comment at the top. These comments get hundreds of replies and thousands of likes. Typical examples are: "Subscribe or you'll have bad luck", "Subscribe and you might become a millionaire in a future", "Subscribe for a free Lamborghini".<br><br><br><br>#465. The more views your video gets in the first 24 to 72 hours, the better it performs on YouTube. Having a larger subscriber base can help you get more views when you first upload a video. Once your channel reaches 5,000 subscribers, you can generate views more quickly. Channels with over 100,000 subscribers have a significant advantage. In summary, more subscribers lead to higher video view velocity.<br><br><br>#466. People are more likely to subscribe to and watch videos from YouTubers with a big following, even if they're new to them. It's because having more followers makes them seem like experts in their field. This is especially true for channels offering instructional videos. It's an authority bias and it hurts small creators.<br><br><br>#467. Does subscriber count even matter anymore? Yes, it still does. First, the more subs you have, the more you are seen as an expert in your field. Second, higher subscriber count means more attention from brands interested in sponsoring your content. For example, once you hit 50,000 subscribers, you will see a substantial uptick in amount of requests for sponsored content.
<h4>Statistics</h4>
#468. When you reach a specific number of subscribers on YouTube, you receive a Play Button Award as a special recognition from the platform.<br>    Silver Play Button for 100,000 subscribers<br>    Golden Play Button for 1 million subscribers<br>    Diamond Play Button for 10 million subscribers<br>    Custom Play Button for 50 million subscribers<br>    Red Diamond Play Button for 100 million subscribers<br>The Red Diamond Play Button is the most prestigious award, and only five channels have achieved it so far.<br><br><br><br>#469. According to the statistics, 90 % of youtubers never reach 10,000 subscribers.<br><br><br><br>#470. MKBHD had 74 subscribers after 100 videos, MrBeast had around 780 subscribers after his first 100 videos, and PewDiePie, who now has over 100 million subscribers, had only 2,500 subscribers after his first 100 videos.<br><br><br>#471. According to Roberto Blake's research, on average, creators need to make about 800 videos to reach 100,000 subscribers and earn a silver play button. To earn a gold play button, they need to make well over 1,000 videos on average.<br><br><br><br>#472. According to TubeBuddy and Roberto Blake, "on average, it usually takes most content creators about roughly five years in order to get to 10,000 subscribers on YouTube". Some of the reasons of this:<br>- people have a full-time job and can't fully commit to making videos<br>- people have families<br>- people have kids to take care of<br>A lot of content creators who managed to grow very fast were young and didn't have a full-time job.<br><br><br><br>#473. Most of youtubers get less than half of all views from their subscribers.<br><br><br>#474. Usually the number of subscribers a channel has is about 1% of their overall view count. So, if you have accumulated 100,000 views, most likely your channel has 1000 subscribers. Roberto Blake calls it a "1% rule".<br><br><br><br>#475. According to TubeFilter, on average, it takes about 22 months to reach 1,000 subscribers on YouTube.
<h3>Playlists</h3>
#476. Use playlists to share videos on social media. Instead of just sharing one video, share a link to the playlist with that video as the first one. If people like that video, they can keep watching more from the playlist. This increases YouTube session watch time, which is important to improve rankings on YouTube.<br><br><br><br>#477. Put playlists instead of individual videos on your websites and blogs that you own or manage. You can also do this on platforms like Medium, a blogging site, and Tumblr, among others.<br><br><br><br>#478. Put your best videos at the beginning of the playlist, and the less good ones at the end, except cases when the videos need to be watched in a specific order.<br><br><br><br>#479. Place your most popular or relevant playlists at the top of the page, this helps attract and retain viewers.<br><br><br><br>#480. If you have a series of related videos or playlists, you may want to group them together so that viewers can easily find all of the content related to that topic.<br><br><br>#481. Consider creating a custom playlist titled "New to [your channel name]? Start Here!" Choose the videos you want to include in this playlist and arrange them in a specific order.<br>Include two types of videos in this playlist:<br>1. Videos that best represent your channel's tone, quality, value, and overall feel.<br>2. Videos that have successfully converted non-subscribed viewers into subscribers, which you can determine through YouTube analytics.<br><br><br>#482. Playlists can rank in search results alongside channels and videos. In fact, even if the individual videos in a playlist may not rank well on their own, the playlist as a whole can sometimes outperform the individual videos.<br><br><br>#483. Not only can playlists increase exposure in search results, but they also keep viewers engaged by displaying a list of related videos alongside the one they are watching. When sharing a video, use the playlist mode link to encourage viewers to explore more of your content. To do this, go to your playlist, select the desired video, and use the URL from the address bar. Alternatively, when watching the video from your playlist, find the playlist mode URL by clicking on the Share tab below the video.<br><br><br>#484. In the playlist settings, you'll find an option to "Add new videos to top of playlist." By default, new videos are added to the bottom, which can give the impression that the playlist isn't updating. However, checking this option will automatically add new videos to the beginning of the playlist, so that viewers see your latest content first.<br><br><br>#485. Playlists have another valuable aspect: they can increase the overall watch time on YouTube by keeping viewers engaged and watching more of your videos. This increased watch time can positively impact the ranking of your videos in search results, making playlists a beneficial tool for improving visibility.
<h3>Stories</h3>
#486. Stories are short, mobile videos that let you connect with your audience in a casual way. They last for seven days and can be seen on the Homepage. They're similar to stories on other platforms, with a rolling view that shows new stories on the right side. Think of the Story feed as a banner or billboard for your brand.
<h2>Making money on YouTube</h2>
#487. To increase your earnings, it's important to choose a niche that pays well. For example, finance is one of the most viewed niches on YouTube and has one of the highest CPMs on the platform.<br><br><br><br>#488. Don’t even think about money within the first months of your journey. Instead, always remember that you will be making a lot of money in the long run once you grow true fans loyal to your channel or your product.<br><br><br><br>#489. Don't join MCNs. MCNs (Multi-Channel Networks) are third-party companies that provide services to YouTube content creators. These services can include video production, marketing and promotion, audience development, content strategy, monetization, and more. MCNs often offer creators access to tools, resources, and expertise that can help them grow their channels and maximize their earnings. In exchange, MCNs typically take a percentage of the revenue generated by the content creators they represent. While MCNs were once a popular way for creators to monetize their content and grow their channels, the rise of YouTube's own monetization features and other third-party tools has led to a decline in the importance of MCNs in the YouTube ecosystem. MCNs were helpful back in the day, when gaming channels couldn't get into the partnership program and joining an MCN was their only chance to see any ad revenue. As a downside of it, MCNs took up to half of their earnings. Even PewDiePie with 30,000 subscribers could only earn money on YouTube through an MCN.<br><br><br><br>#490. Set up a Patreon account to let your fans support you. Provide your patreons with exclusive content once a month.<br><br><br><br>#491. Surrounding yourself with like-minded people can be helpful for feedback and connections. These connections can even lead to brand deals, freelance clients, and part-time employees when you need them.<br><br><br><br>#492. Some of the most profitable niches on Youtube:<br>- car and automotive<br>- outdoor and adventure<br>- marketing<br>- photo and video gear<br>- eCommerce<br>- productivity<br>- tutorials<br>- podcasting<br><br><br><br>#493. Best 6 profitable niches for making money online<br>- creator economy<br>- family and lifestyle<br>- saas<br>- news and current events (incl. podcasting)<br>- online education<br>- design and branding<br><br><br><br>#494. Most profitable niches on Youtube:<br>- ecommerce, personal finance<br>- tech channels<br>- lifestyle<br>- real estate<br>- software tutorials<br><br><br><br>#495. But on Skillshare, you stand to make about three to eight cents per minute watched.<br><br><br><br>#496. Skillshare pays 3 to 8 cents per minute watched. Skillshare has the same business model as Netflix, but in the education niche.
<h3>Ad revenue</h3>
#497. Consider removing non-skippable ads because they don't necessarily pay more and can turn off your audience, causing them to stop watching your videos.<br><br><br><br>#498. Focus on promoting the videos that generate the highest revenue. To identify them in YouTube Analytics, Click on the Revenue option in the top menu. You will now see a list of all your videos with their corresponding revenue for the selected time period. You can sort the list by revenue to see which videos are bringing in the most money.<br><br><br><br>#499. A good strategy is to create playlists and themes around your top-earning content. Instead of promoting individual videos, promote these profitable playlists. By creating binge-worthy loops around these videos, you increase the chances of them being picked up, promoted, and distributed by YouTube. This could lead to even more views and engagement, as YouTube promotes content that is receiving attention. By optimizing both your valuable videos and profitable playlists, you can improve their searchability on YouTube, especially if you create evergreen content.<br><br><br><br>#500. Make more videos similar to your most profitable videos, based on their CPM and RPM rates.<br><br><br><br>#501. If your video is shorter than eight minutes, YouTube won't put mid-roll and post-roll ads on it. To get more chances for ad placement without ruining the viewer's experience, you could consider creating an extended version of the video on the same topic or theme.<br><br><br><br>#502. After your content is approved for ads, they won't automatically start paying you. You have to manually turn on ads for your videos in the moderation dashboard and select all your previous videos to turn monetization on for them too, so you can start earning from them. Many people forget to do this step and then wonder why they are not earning money.<br><br><br><br>#503. The main issue with fair use is often with movie/TV show reviews and game play videos, mostly due to music licensing. To avoid this, you can turn off background music in the game settings, since you might have permission for the game footage, but not for the music.<br><br><br><br>#504. If you are monetized, consider not putting ads in the middle of your videos if you want to grow.<br><br><br><br>#505. Ad revenue isn't the most reliable way of income.<br><br><br><br>#506. Usual place for a manually placed mid-roll videos is where you are not talking in a video.<br><br><br><br>#507. Post your most performing video in terms of monetary income to your Community tab as a classic but timeless piece of content. After you review your most successful and profitable videos, create similar content to them. If a specific video earned a lot of money regardless of views, you can likely get similar ad placements and frequency on content that is similar. This is because YouTube and its ad system try to match advertisers with relevant content. Therefore, if a video already matched for high paying ads, create more content that can match with those ads. It's important to note that not all videos and ads are the same, as different ads play on different videos based on various factors like genre, category, and season. Keep this in mind when creating content.<br><br><br><br>#508. Stop cursing in your videos. Using curse words on the platform reduces the number of ads you can qualify for because some advertisers avoid certain types of content. Content that has bad words in the first 8 seconds of it is not monetizable.<br><br><br><br>#509. Just because someone watches your video doesn't mean they'll see an ad. Usually, YouTubers only get an ad view for about 30% of their total views.<br><br><br><br>#510. It's a good idea to include a commercial break every 8 to 12 minutes. By this point, many viewers will start to lose interest, so it's similar to what happens in TV shows.<br><br><br><br>#511. Don’t rely just on the ad money from Youtube Partnership Program. Use affiliate marketing, brand deals, merchandise and other streams of income. Not only it increases your income, but also makes it more stable.<br><br><br><br>#512. Entertainment channels usually can't boast about having good CPMs. It's normal for them to have 1,000,000 views and only get 500 or 1,000 dollars in ad revenue, even if they regularly manage to make viral videos.<br><br><br><br>#513. Besides ad revenue, YPP gives other ways to make money, like channel memberships, live stream Super Chat and Super Stickers, a merchandise shelf, and a share of the YouTube Premium subscribers' fee when they watch your content.<br><br><br><br>#514. The majority of YouTube creators are male so there is more competition among advertisers who want to collaborate with female creators.<br><br><br>#515. YouTube Partnership Program can bring you money in several ways:<br>- advertising revenue<br>- channel memberships (viewers pay monthly fee for exclusive access)<br>- selling merchandise<br>- live stream enhancements (super chat, super stickers)<br>- YouTube Premium (share of the money YouTube receives from users who have the YouTube Premium subscription)
<h4>Applying for monetization</h4>
#516. Once your channel hits one thousand subscribers and four thousand hours of watch time over a period of 12 months, apply for Youtube Partnership Program to be able to receive a share of the ad revenue.<br><br><br><br>#517. It's important to create your Google AdSense account before applying for the YouTube Partner Program. To receive direct deposits, you'll need to provide your bank account and routing number.<br><br><br><br>#518. The more original content you have on your channel, the higher are your chances to be approved into the monetization program. Be very careful when using other youtuber's content, when uploading content from other platforms like TikTok or uploading movie or TV show footage. Avoid taking unnecessary risks at least until you're monetized.<br><br><br><br>#519. For monetization, only the watch time needs to be accumulated over the period of the last 12 months.<br><br><br><br>#520. Creating YouTube Shorts won't help you meet the requirements to join the YouTube Partner Program and earn money from YouTube as they don't contribute to your watch time total.<br><br><br><br>#521. If you do a 24-hour or 24/7 live stream, it won't count towards the public watch time required to qualify for monetization. This is because it never really ends and doesn't get published.<br><br><br><br>#522. Unlisted and deleted videos also don't count toward the qualified watch time for YouTube monetization. Only public videos matter.<br><br><br><br>#523. If a channel is denied when applying for YPP (YouTube Partner Program) for the first time, they will have 21 days to appeal or wait for 30 days before they can reapply. If the channel reapplies after 30 days and gets rejected again, they will still have 21 days to appeal but will need to wait for 90 days before they can reapply. That seems reasonable. If your channel is rejected twice, it suggests that there are fundamental issues with meeting the monetization policies. YouTube doesn't want to invest time in repeat applicants who have a low chance of being accepted into the YouTube Partner Program when there are new applicants who are more likely to be accepted.<br><br><br>#524. After you've applied for monetization, Youtube team will manually check your channel for content policy compliance. This usually takes up to 48 hours, but sometimes goes for weeks and up to a month.<br><br><br>#525. Track the status of your application through the YouTube Studio dashboard, "Monetization" tab. I can be "Under Review", "Approved" or "Not Eligible". Once you're approved, you gain access to monetization features.
<h3>Sponsorships (Brand deals)</h3>
#526. Before you<br><br><br>#527. Don’t wait for sponsors to reach out to you. Reach out to them! Even if your channel only has 1500 subscribers.<br><br><br>#528. Only have brand deals with sponsors whose product is appropriate for your audience. For example, if you’re a children’s toy channel, don’t promote alcohol beverages.<br><br><br>#529. Only start looking for sponsors when your channel hits 1000 subscribers. Before that companies will see little benefit sponsoring you.<br><br><br>#530. The easiest way to find sponsors is to ask other youtubers for the emails of sponsors they worked with in the past. If you ask nicely, most of the time they say yes as they expect that you will do the same for them.<br><br><br>#531. Once you have emails of potential sponsors, send them an initial message. Keep it short. To save you a lot of work, base your emails off of a template, but be sure to slightly personalize each message, because copy-paste emails are easily detectable and are frowned upon. In your email, tell briefly why you want this company to sponsor you. Don't tell them your rates just yet in case they can offer you more money than you ask.<br><br><br>#532. This is an example of an initial email. Replace the text in brackets with your information.<br><br>Hello<br>My name is [Robert Smith] and I'm reaching out for a collaboration inquiry.<br><br>I own the [Robert Smith Reviews] Youtube Channel, a [tech reviews] channel with [1056] subscribers averaging [300] views per video.<br><br>I would like to integrate [South VPN] into our next video through a [ad read] as my channel has a strong audience base that is interested in technology, and as my viewers trust my opinions and recommendations.<br><br>Please let me know if you are interested.<br><br>My channel link: https://www.youtube.com/@RobertSmithTechReviews<br><br>Regards,<br>Robert<br><br><br>#533. There are two main ways that companies work with YouTubers to advertise their products: ad reads and dedicated videos. Ad reads are when YouTubers quickly talk about a product for about 30-90 seconds in their video. Dedicated videos are when the product is featured throughout the entire video. Ad reads are easier, but some companies prefer dedicated videos.<br><br><br>#534. Once you have a response from a sponsor, it's time to write them a second email. First, thank them for their interest. Second, ask them for their rates. Once again, don't tell them your rates yet, even if they asked you about it in the email.<br><br><br>#535. It usually takes several emails back and forth until all the details are figured out. Some sponsors will send you a contract to sign. Some will only do it if you insist.<br><br><br>#536. Now it's time to create the sponsored video. Once it's ready, upload it to YouTube UNLISTED and send the link to the sponsor for review.<br><br><br>#537. Be sure to fix every issue they might have with the video and reupload the updated result also UNLISTED.<br><br><br>#538. Once you're given green light to upload, make the video public.<br><br><br>#539. Now it's time to get your money. Send the sponsor your PayPal info or whatever you agreed on for payment.<br><br><br>#540. When you include sponsored segments in your videos, you might see some dips in your viewership during those parts. This is normal and it's just something you have to accept as the cost of having sponsors.<br><br><br>#541. Don't say "yes" to every sponsor that comes your way, even if you are a very small youtuber.<br><br><br>#542. If you're aiming for higher paid brand deals on YouTube, you need to prove your worth as a salesperson. One way to do this is by showing your audience's buying power. You can demonstrate this by showcasing your sales on your own products, like merchandise or digital services. For example, if you sell camera gear and use Amazon Affiliate sales, you can negotiate higher paying brand deals by proving your audience's interest in specific categories and affinity for the represented brands. By proving that your audience is willing to spend money on products, you can show potential sponsors that you have a buying audience.<br><br><br>#543. Always make sure to have a signed contract before entering any brand deals.<br><br><br>#544. Don't agree to any deal that gives the brand ownership of your content.<br><br><br>#545. Avoid brand deals that demand a specific number of views or need those views within a particular timeframe.<br><br><br>#546. Find brands in your niche that work with creators and make a list of the ones you want to work with.<br><br><br>#547. To work with a brand, you can try to find someone who works with them on Twitter or in marketing, or check their website for a PR page with a contact email.<br><br><br>#548. If you're a small content creator looking for brand deals, try using marketplaces like FameBit, Grapevine Logic, or IZEA. These are places where you can bid on brand deals, but be aware that some have requirements like a minimum number of followers or subscribers. The required numbers may vary, so you'll need to do some research to find out the specific requirements for each platform.<br><br><br>#549. Ask your youtuber friends about their rates.<br><br><br>#550. For sponsors, your recent average views are more important than total channel views.
<h3>Affiliate marketing</h3>
#551. Remember about affiliate marketing. With affiliate marketing, you can make money by promoting products or services in your videos. You tell about a product and put the affiliate link in the description to your video. When someone clicks on the link and makes a purchase, you earn a commission on the sale (usually 1 to 10 %).<br><br><br>#552. Start affiliate marketing early, even before your channel hits monetization.<br><br><br>#553. Actively search for companies having affiliate programs such as Amazon Associates (also Bass Pro Shops, Home Depot, Kohl’s, Nordstrom, Sephora, Target, Walmart, CJ (Commission Junction)).<br><br><br><br>#554. Affiliate marketing is not a fast way to make money, but over time, it's a simple way to earn extra cash without doing much.<br><br><br><br>#555. It's a good idea to choose products that you've actually used.<br><br><br><br>#556. Comparing products, such as a $50 microphone versus a $500 microphone, can create engaging videos.<br><br><br><br>#557. One of the simplest ways to build credibility as an affiliate marketer is by promoting products that you personally use. Demonstrating these products through tutorials and reviews is particularly effective, as it allows your audience to see how the item works and how you use it in your daily life. When your viewers see that you are genuinely invested in a product, it helps to build trust and make them more likely to make a purchase.<br><br><br><br>#558. The best way to promote something is to base it on your own experiences and opinions.
<h4>Affiliate program overview</h4>
#559. Most popular affiliate marketing programs are: Amazon Associates, ShareASale, ClickBank. However, many companies behind some very well-known products and services have their own affiliate programs. Adobe, Epidemic Sound, Logitech, Unity Game Engine, just to name a few. Generalized programs such as Amazon or Clickbank offer a broad range of products for promotion, but in contrast, they have lower commission rates than specific programs.<br><br><br>#560. TubeBuddy is a good example of recurring affiliate program.<br><br><br>#561. When choosing products to promote, it's important to select ones with a high commission rate. Usually, products with a high markup, such as digital courses, ebooks, and luxury clothing, offer higher commissions.<br><br><br>#562. Amazon doesn't only pay you when someone clicks on your link and buys a specific item. They also give you commissions for any purchases made on Amazon within 24 hours of clicking your link.<br><br><br>#563. Another helpful tip is to recommend free items on Amazon, such as Audible, which won't cost your audience anything. They can sign up for a free trial and keep the audio book forever, while you earn a $5 commission. There are also other programs on Amazon and other affiliate platforms that have $0 sign-up fees and offer bonuses and commissions. If someone signs up through your link and becomes a customer, you can earn even higher commissions.<br><br><br>#564. Look for recurring affiliate programs.<br>A recurring affiliate program is a type of affiliate marketing program where affiliates receive commissions for every recurring payment made by the customer they referred to the product or service. This means that as long as the customer remains subscribed or continues to use the service, the affiliate will continue to receive a commission.<br><br>Here are a few examples of recurring affiliate programs:<br>- subscription-based services: Spotify, Netflix, and Amazon Prime<br>- web hosting services<br>- health and wellness products<br>- online education platforms: Udemy, Skillshare<br>- software as a service (SaaS) products: project management tools, email marketing software, and CRM systems.<br><br><br><br>#565. The easiest way to start making money with Audible is through their $5 flat fee free trial. You can recommend an audio book to people which they get to keep for free forever. You'll get a $5 commission for each person who signs up, and to make $100 you just need to refer 20 people who spend $0.
<h4>Promoting affiliate products</h4>
#566. Be sure to put affiliate links in the description of your video.<br><br><br>#567. Some creators choose to go beyond just including affiliate links and actively promote products in their videos. While this can result in higher commission rates, it also requires more effort. Personally, if I feature a company in one of my videos, I prefer to be directly compensated through a brand deal.<br><br><br><br>#568. We can go beyond promoting affiliate links on videos. If you are active on other platforms, such as newsletters, blogs, Twitter, Instagram, or Discord servers, promote them there as well. You can also promote affiliate links during live streams.<br><br><br><br>#569. It's important to be honest with your audience by disclosing that you'll earn commission from the links in your description. This builds trust and ensures you follow FTC guidelines. The FTC requires social media influencers to clearly disclose paid endorsements or sponsorships in their content, and affiliate links are included in this category. Therefore, it's crucial to be cautious and transparent.<br><br><br><br>#570. For affiliate marketing, it's really helpful to have all your gear always in the background on your footage sitting on a shelf.<br><br><br><br>#571. The absolute minimum that you should do is specify in the description to your videos what gear (camera, microphone, lighting) you use as an affiliate link. Some vloggers put everything they use on camera into the description and name this section "Products in this video:".<br><br><br><br>#572. You can easily update descriptions to hundreds of videos at once using TubeBuddy's find and replace tool. This allows to add or change links to your own website or Amazon Affiliate, among other things.<br><br><br>#573. It's crucial to make it easy for your viewers to click on the specific affiliate links that you mention in your YouTube videos. While including them in the video description or verbally calling them out is helpful, it's not always the most convenient option. You can maximize engagement by making this link the pinned comment of your video, as this is the first thing that many viewers will see.
<h3>Merchandise</h3>
#574. When selling merch like T-Shirts, make their design less about you and more about your community. This in particular means that putting your face on them is not such a good idea. Instead, consider putting on it your channel's motto, something that both you and your audience believe in.<br><br><br><br>#575. Make professional, high-quality designs. You can find good and inexpensive designer on Fiverr.<br><br><br><br>#576. Promote your merch in your videos. If it's a T-Shirt, at the vey least wear it when filming yourself. But saying a few words about it will be even better.<br><br><br><br>#577. Before promoting your merchandise to your audience, obtain physical samples and use them yourself to ensure their quality matches your promotion. This personal inspection can help ensure that the merchandise lives up to the standard you advertise to your audience.<br><br><br>#578. Usually, you can earn around $5 to $8 on most print-on-demand items after subtracting the cost.<br><br><br>#579. An article in Promo Marketing magazine revealed that merchandise click-throughs on YouTube generate 30% more traffic compared to other features like banner links, annotations, and description links. Viewers who want to support or showcase a brand often seek out mugs, stuffed animals, and T-shirts, which remain popular choices.<br><br><br>#580. The YouTube merchandise shelf has been highly profitable for many creators. It appears below videos and offers a range of items beyond T-shirts. In collaboration with Teespring, YouTube enables creators to design and sell branded merchandise such as bags, pillows, blankets, stuffed animals, mugs, and more.
<h3>Channel memberships</h3>
#581. To join the channel membership program, you need to meet certain requirements. Gaming channels must have 1,000 subscribers, while other channels need 30,000. You must also be a YouTube Partner and in good standing with YouTube. Keep in mind that the membership program may not be available in all areas. There are some limitations on what you can offer as a membership benefit, such as one-on-one meetings and marketing to children. When it comes to revenue, you receive 70% of the membership fee, while YouTube takes 30%.
<h3>Selling your own products</h3>
#582. Use your channel to sell your own products or services. When you sell your own product, you get to keep all of the money you make instead of just a small percentage. This method is especially beneficial for small youtubers, as it has the potential to generate revenue for you even with a relatively small number of subscribers and views. Here’s a small list of what you can be offering just to get your creativity started: Handmade crafts or products (jewelry, home décor), Digital products (printables, digital art), personalized services (editing, graphic design services), recipe or cooking guides (e-books, meal plans); DIY tutorials or guides (home renovation, car repair guides), workout plans or fitness coaching services, music or audio tracks for use in videos or podcasts, beauty or skincare products (homemade soap, lip balm), personalized merchandise (custom-made t-shirts, stickers), photography or videography services (event or portrait photography), foreign language guides, consultations or tutoring.<br><br><br>#583. If you own a physical business, you can use YouTube as a way to promote it to people outside your area. For example, if you own a store, you can create videos that showcase that store and what you sell, and use YouTube to reach people around the world. Although you won't make money directly from the videos, you can use them to bring in more customers to your store and increase your revenue.
<h3>CPM / RPM</h3>
#584. Your ad revenue is affected by where your viewers live. The highest YouTube CPM (cost per thousand impressions) rates tend to come from regions such as North America, Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. These regions typically have higher rates of advertising spending, which results in higher CPM rates.<br><br><br><br>#585. CPM and RPM are both terms used in digital advertising, but they measure different things.<br><br>CPM stands for "cost per thousand impressions." It is the amount that an advertiser pays for every 1,000 times their ad is shown to users on a platform. CPM is typically used to measure the cost of display and video ads, and it is calculated by dividing the total cost of the campaign by the number of impressions, and then multiplying by 1,000.<br><br>RPM stands for "revenue per thousand impressions." It is the amount of revenue a content creator earns for every 1,000 times their content is shown to users on a platform. RPM is typically used to measure the earnings potential of content creators on platforms like YouTube, and it is calculated by dividing the total revenue earned by the number of impressions, and then multiplying by 1,000.<br><br>In other words, CPM is a metric used by advertisers to measure the cost of ads, while RPM is a metric used by content creators to measure their earnings potential.<br><br><br><br>#586. CPM rates refer to how much advertisers pay for content per 1000 views. RPM, which you can see on your YouTube dashboard, shows how much money you make per 1000 views on your videos after YouTube takes their cut.<br><br><br><br>#587. CPM (Cost per thousand impressions) on YouTube can be influenced by several factors, including:<br><br>    Advertiser demand: When there are more advertisers willing to bid on ads, it drives up the cost of ad space, resulting in a higher CPM.<br><br>    Video content: Advertisers may pay more to place their ads on videos that are popular, high-quality, and relevant to their target audience.<br><br>    Target audience: Ads may be more expensive to target specific demographics or interests, such as age, gender, location, or interests.<br><br>    Ad format: Different ad formats have different CPM rates. For example, skippable ads tend to have a lower CPM than non-skippable ads.<br><br>    Time of year: CPM rates can vary depending on the time of year, with higher rates typically seen during the holiday season or major events.<br><br>    Ad placement: The placement of the ad within the video can also affect CPM. For example, ads placed at the beginning of a video tend to have a higher CPM than those placed at the end.<br><br>    Ad targeting: Ads that are targeted towards a specific topic, niche or industry tend to have a higher CPM than general ads.<br><br><br><br>#588. The CPM can change and may increase when more people advertise, especially during holidays and big events. Advertisers pay more during these times when there are more ads. Think about how many ads you see during Christmas season.
<h2>Security</h2>
#589. My recommendation is to avoid sharing your Google account that controls your YouTube channel and AdSense. It's best not to use a public email account for this purpose and create a separate email address for business and contact purposes. Don't give out this email address publicly to avoid the risk of having your YouTube channel or AdSense stolen. Unfortunately, this happens often. By keeping your email address private, you can better protect your assets.<br><br><br><br>#590. Keep your YouTube channel email private and separate from any public contact information. If you have a business email listed in your About section, make sure it's different from your personal email. While managing multiple email accounts can be a hassle, it's necessary for security and protecting your content.<br><br><br><br>#591. Keep third-party access to your YouTube account to a minimum, especially when it comes to plugins and tools. Stick to using only the ones that are recommended by YouTube or trusted by the YouTube community. Avoid giving third-party accounts access to your channel.<br><br><br><br>#592. Don't share your phone carrier information with anyone, even if you buy a new phone. Keep it to yourself and don't disclose the phone carrier you're signed up with.<br><br><br><br>#593. To protect yourself from a SIM card swap request, you need to ask your provider to set up a security pass phrase. If you don't request it, there's a chance your provider won't require it and someone could impersonate you with basic information. Make sure to get the pass phrase notated in your account for added security. If you share a lot of personal information on your YouTube channel, hackers can use that to their advantage. They can use the "Forgot Password" option and trick the two-factor authentication process by getting the code on their own phone instead of yours. This is how they bypass the security measures and gain access to your account, ultimately locking you out.<br><br><br><br>#594. To protect yourself from hacking, you can consider getting a separate phone and number only for your social media and two-factor authentication. It's an extreme step, but if you can afford it, it's worth doing. Make sure nobody knows the number and use it only for these purposes. You should also limit the devices that have access to your YouTube channel.<br><br><br><br>#595. Try to avoid using public wifi as much as possible, especially when working on sensitive information. Although the pandemic quarantine makes it easier to avoid public wifi, some people still like to work at coffee shops or restaurants. However, minimizing public wifi usage can make you less vulnerable to potential security threats.<br><br><br><br>#596. Use antivirus software on your devices to protect yourself from potential threats. Even if you use Apple devices, it's a good idea to use antivirus software.<br><br><br><br>#597. Finally, there is another hardware option you can consider - a physical token. For YouTube and Google accounts, it's called the Google Titan Key. These keys require an investment, but there are other companies that make similar keys, such as UB. These keys are basically small fobs that you can use to physically unlock your device and access your Google account, providing an extra layer of security for your two-factor authentication. Google's Advanced Security allows you to set up this option. I'll link to some security resources in the description.<br><br><br><br>#598. When you receive emails from Google AdSense or YouTube, assume they are scams. Check your account first before opening any email, as they will usually contact you through the system first. Don't assume the email is legit, as scammers will use tricks like account termination, copyright claims, or invalid click activity to frighten you. You can identify scam emails by checking if the email address is from google.com. Google and YouTube don't require you to click on anything in these emails, and they never ask for your password.<br><br><br><br>#599. Don't link your other social media accounts to the same Gmail account you use for YouTube to avoid possible security breaches, because those ones can be compromised too.<br><br><br><br>#600. Don't use any browser plugins that aren't certified by YouTube. Stick with certified plugins like vidIQ, TubeBuddy, Social Blade, VideoAmigo, and Morningfame. These are the main ones that are trustworthy for YouTubers.<br><br><br><br>#601. If you receive an email about a sponsorship or brand deal, and they ask for access to your Youtube account through a link or click, avoid it.<br><br><br><br>#602. If you receive a sponsor email without a website or phone number, it's likely fake. If the first email asks you to click on something, it's probably a phishing scam. Clicking could give them access to your Google or YouTube account. So, don't click on it and avoid it completely. Smaller YouTubers are more likely to fall for this because they're excited to get their first brand deal, and scammers know it and use it to their advantage.<br><br><br><br>#603. Make sure that your "About" page doesn't show the email address linked to your YouTube account and Google AdSense. Otherwise scammers may use that information to target you.<br><br><br><br>#604. Check for viruses every file that you receive via email (that includes seemingly harmless files like images or documents). This helps you protect yourself and your channel from potential cyber threats and avoid the risk of losing valuable content or even your entire channel.<br><br><br><br>#605. Enable two-factor authentication. It adds an extra layer of security to your account. When enabled, you will be required to enter a unique code in addition to your password to log in.
<h3>Passwords</h3>
#606. Use a password manager with a strong, unreadable password generated by the program. Avoid using your own passwords. Consider using a password manager that allows you to have different passwords for each website. Some recommended password managers are Dashlane, LastPass, and 1Password. Although it may be inconvenient, it's essential to use a password manager to protect your security.<br><br><br>#607. Don't use a universal password for everything. Have a unique password for each service.<br><br><br><br>#608. Use a password that is difficult to guess. Avoid using common words or phrases, use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The more characters it has the better.<br><br><br>#609. Change your password regularly (once a year is recommended). Don't share it with anybody. If there is any suspicion of a security breach or unauthorized access, change the password immediately.
<h2>Niche-specific tips</h2>

<h3>Gaming/Letsplays</h3>
#610. Focusing on popular games, which are already heavily saturated with videos on YouTube, can be incredibly challenging for newcomers to get noticed. Instead, shift your attention towards smaller indie games that had recently been released and don't have much content available for it yet. Strive for being among the first in whatever you do. If a new game is released, make it a priority to be the first to upload tips videos for that game.<br><br><br>#611. When others say you're funny, it carries more weight than if you say it about yourself, especially when you lack an audience or any evidence to support the claim.<br><br><br>#612. Even if you're incredibly funny, it won't make a difference if your thumbnails are unappealing and your latest video has a generic title like "Fortnite Part 9."<br><br><br>#613. Creating guides, tutorials, and reviews is an effective method to attract viewers and grow your channel. Offering a diverse range of content can be beneficial for expanding your audience.<br><br><br><br>#614. Viewers are generally less inclined to click on Part 50 of a Let's Play series.<br><br><br>#615. Many popular gaming YouTubers have distinguished themselves by going beyond simply playing and commenting on games. They approach games with specific ideas or goals in mind, such as attempting to break or exploit them, engaging in silly, funny, or unusual activities, and then sharing their experiences in a concise and entertaining manner. Some of them invest several hours of gameplay just to create a single unique video. This approach stands in stark contrast to the traditional format of lengthy Let's Play series like "Minecraft LP #500 Expanding My Base" or similar content.<br><br><br>#616. Instead of recording everything, try being selective about what you choose to record. It's called edited recording because you're only capturing what you want and leaving out the rest. This approach saves a lot of time since you have less footage to work with.<br>However, it's important to note that this method may not be suitable for certain types of recordings, especially in multiplayer games where you might risk missing out on important moments.<br><br><br>#617. Promote your content on traditional internet forums dedicated to your niche if they are still available. One major benefit of forums is the presence of signatures, allowing to promote your channel simply by engaging in discussions and posting.<br>Additionally, utilize Twitter hashtags and comment on popular posts, which may result in thousands of impressions for your content.<br><br><br>#618. Some websites to find copyright free assets for your videos:<br>Pixabay, Pexels, Unsplash, Vecteezy, Mixkit, Freesounds
<h3>Faceless channels (YouTube automation)</h3>
#619. As of today, YouTube and Google are having trouble detecting AI-generated content. Using scripts for videos doesn't seem to affect monetization. But it's a good idea to add your own personal touch to the scripts. The AI's writing can be a bit plain and repetitive, so make sure to inject some human creativity and uniqueness into the final version.<br><br><br>#620. Try computer-generated voices from WellSaid. However, it's important to note that some of the high-quality voices are only available with a $99 monthly account. This might be too expensive for many people, unless they plan on creating numerous voiceovers every month.<br><br><br>#621. I found this amazing AI voice tool from ElevenLabs. It has the best quality voice I've heard so far. However, it has a few limitations. It offers fewer voice options and you can't customize the voice much. They also charge for each voice generation, and the recorded voice sounds different each time you use a script, leading to varying tones. Sometimes it sounds too energetic, while other times it's more monotone and boring. Working with ElevenLabs can be challenging as it lacks control and requires additional tools for editing and fixing spacing. Despite these drawbacks, I believe it has the potential to become one of the best AI voices.<br><br><br>#622. Pictory is a great tool for creating videos using AI. It matches stock footage and clips from Storyblocks to your video script. This makes video creation much easier. You can also upload your AI voiceover from Descript, and Pictory will automatically synchronize the video clips and text to match. It saves a lot of time and money compared to using Storyblocks with a video editing software. You can further enhance the video by adding transitions, music, or text annotations. Overall, Pictory remains the top AI video generation tool in my opinion.<br><br><br>#623. To ensure a 100% success rate in monetization, follow these steps:<br>- use a high-quality AI voice that sounds like a real person, not a robotic-sounding free voice that anyone can use.<br>- incorporate high-quality stock footage that changes frequently, along with text-to-speech annotations.<br>- create an original script for the video.<br>- By combining a unique voice, video content, and text in a specific way, it's highly unlikely that someone else has used the exact same combination.<br>- This approach results in original, high-quality videos that demonstrate effort and increase the likelihood of monetization.<br><br><br>#624. Channels using a quality AI voice and whiteboard animation are monetizable as of 2023.<br><br><br>#625. If you use a famous person's motivational speech for your video, along with paid stock footage and text annotations, it's unlikely to be monetized. You're essentially taking someone else's voice and script without permission, which is considered stealing. There's also a risk of copyright strikes from the original channel. It's best to create original content to avoid these issues.<br><br><br>#626. If you use a Reddit story with an AI voice, captions, and stock footage, there's a chance it can be monetized as long as you add something to the story. However, if you simply read the story without any commentary or changes, it may be flagged as reused content. It's difficult to know if others have already used the same story. To make it original, you should add more value or repurpose it in some way.<br><br><br>#627. If you use your own footage recorded on your phone and add a text-to-speech commentary over it (since you don't want to use your own voice), your video is likely to get monetized. Since the content is original and you have put effort into creating it, YouTube has no reason to withhold monetization. You have contributed valuable and unique content to the platform.
