<h1>279 Tips on Making Money on YouTube</h1>
<h2>Starting a Youtube channel</h2>
#1. Don’t be paralyzed by the fear to start out on Youtube. The fastest way to overcome this fear is to actually get started.<br><br><br><br>#2. Choose a niche for your channel and stick to it. Don’t just upload random videos.<br><br><br><br>#10. Don't spend too much time perfecting your channel's avatar, art, or About page when starting out.  Since there won't be many viewers initially, it's unlikely that anybody will spend their time examining your channel's design. Invest that time in making another video. You can always improve the look of your channel later when you see some traction.<br><br><br><br>#11. Accept the fact that Youtube is almost never an overnight success. Instead, it’s several months of hard work without seeing much result.<br><br><br><br>#12. Accept the fact that being a youtuber almost never means “just doing whatever you enjoy doing and getting paid for that”. Instead, you will have to be constantly doing what your audience enjoys.<br><br><br><br>#13. If you lose motivation along the way, do the following exercise. Think deeply about why you want to be on YouTube, what you want to achieve, and what your channel's goal is. Write your answers down and put them somewhere you can see them. Whenever you feel lost, scared or unsure, look at your answers and remind yourself why you started.<br><br><br>#1. Don't confuse consistency with quantity and value with quality.<br><br><br><br>#2. Is it too late to start a YouTube channel? No. But it's too late to exploit manipulative techniques trying to make your videos go viral. And it's also too late to become successful churning out low-effort videos. Yes, it's too late to start a Youtube channel now if your intention is to hack the algorithm.<br><br><br><br>#3. A lot of people quit YouTube early because they don't see progress right away.<br><br><br><br>#4. Keep in mind that you're asking other people for their time, which is valuable. You should consider why they should spend five or ten minutes watching your content. It's not about what you deserve, but what you can provide to your audience and what they want and need. Don't feel entitled to views or an audience, because no one is entitled to that. Why should they watch your videos? Working hard doesn't mean you deserve views and subscribers because nobody deserves anything.
<h3>Choosing a niche</h3>
#3. Your channel niche must be:<br>1. something you’re passionate about<br>2. something you know a lot about (or willing to learn)<br>3. something that can potentially bring money<br>Youtube is almost never an overnight success. The first several months will be lots of work and not much result. Without passion, you'll give up and quit.<br>Also, channels focusing on daily vlogging or hobbies that are too niche might not have enough potential for monetization.<br><br><br><br>#4. How do you find what you're truly passionate about?<br>You're truly passionate about something if:<br>1. You are willing to do it for free<br>2. You can talk about it for hours<br>3. It has been like this for at least a year (otherwise it might be just a temporary interest in something)<br><br><br><br>#5. When choosing a niche, look for the biggest channels in that niche. If you can’t find a channel that has 50-100k subs, then the niche is probably too small. In a small niche you'll struggle to make enough money.<br><br><br><br><br>#5. If you make gaming videos and gaming hardware reviews, it's not a good idea to also do fitness videos on the same channel. Your audience would be confused and it would be harder for YouTube to recommend your content to the right viewers. (c, R. Blake's examples, rewritten by ChatGPT)<br><br>I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Here are some improved examples:<br><br>    You could do makeup tutorials, beauty product reviews, and skincare routines on the same YouTube channel, but you probably couldn't do that and also do car repair tutorials. The topics are too different and will likely confuse your audience.<br><br>    You could do travel vlogs, hotel reviews, and destination guides on the same YouTube channel, but you probably couldn't do that and also do makeup tutorials. The topics are too unrelated and may not appeal to the same audience.<br><br>    You could do fashion hauls, clothing reviews, and outfit ideas on the same YouTube channel, but you probably couldn't do that and also do video game let's plays. The topics are too different and may not attract the same viewers.<br><br><br><br>#6. Think about something that excites you so much that you can get others excited about it too. But make sure it's worth their time, not just yours.<br><br><br><br>#7. It's also important to be good at your niche.<br><br><br><br>#8. Niche down. Become the best in your smaller niche and then expand.
<h3>Channel name</h3>
#6. When promoting a personal brand or individual expertise, consider using a channel name consisting of just your first and last name.<br><br><br><br>#7. Consider including the keywords of your niche as part of your channel name. Good real life examples: Learn English with Emma, Yoga with Adriene.<br><br><br><br>#8. If some big creator is already using the same name you were planning to use for your channel, it's best to choose a different name. Otherwise when people search for you, they will likely find that guy instead, and on top of that you might get accused of clickbaiting them.
<h3>Channel art</h3>
#9. If you're building a business-related channel, including a picture of yourself in your channel art is a good idea. It'll help you make a strong connection with your viewers.
<h3>Profile picture</h3>
#10. You might also want to put a logo in your profile picture instead of your face. The profile picture is small, and it's difficult to see a face, but the logo is noticeable.
<h3>Channel trailer</h3>
#11. Make a good channel trailer that's usually around one minute long. You can make it up to two minutes, but not any longer than that.<br><br><br><br>#12. It's not mandatory to have a dedicated video as your channel trailer. It's perfectly fine to put one of your regular videos as a trailer. Consider making a trailer:<br>- the video that brings your channel the most subscribers<br>- your most recent video (as additional promotion)<br>- one of your underperforming videos to help it gain more views.
<h3>"About" section</h3>
#13. Make sure that your "About" page doesn't show the email address linked to your YouTube account and Google AdSense. Otherwise scammers may use that information to target you.<br><br><br><br>#9. When writing the text on the About page, use less of “I” and “me” and more of “you” and “your”.<br>Bad: "Welcome to MY channel! I'M a passionate cook and I'll be sharing MY favorite recipes with you. I started this channel to showcase MY culinary skills and share MY love for cooking with everyone."<br>Good: "Welcome to our channel! We're here to provide YOU with helpful tips and tricks on cooking delicious meals at home. We want to share our passion for food with YOU and help YOU elevate YOUR cooking game."
<h2>Content strategy</h2>
#14. Roberto Blake recommends making 100 videos in a single topic. He himself made 100 videos on graphic design which brought him 87,000 subscribers. Markiplier made over 100 "Five Nights At Freddy's" videos. PewDiePie's biggest series was "Amnesia". If you create 100 videos on one topic, you can become known for it. When your audience watches one of your videos, they get recommended a dozen others in "suggested", which lets them binge watch your content. This can ultimately help to grow your channel more effectively than just creating one or a few videos.<br><br><br><br>#15. Once you find your niche and learn what works for you, apply the Pareto principle, or 80 / 20 rule, to your content. 80 % of your monthly videos should be focused on topics that you know will perform well based on your audience's preferences. Let yourself experiment with the other 20 %. This won't hurt your channel growth, but at the same time will possibly help you find new working ideas. On top of that, it  can prevent burnout, frustration and improve your work/life balance.<br><br><br><br>#16. Stop chasing big youtubers. Trying to emulate big YouTubers without their resources, budget, and experience doesn't make sense because the gap between where they are and where you are is too big.<br><br><br><br>#17. Don't make your content for you. Make it for people like you.<br><br><br><br>#18. Many of you are trying to imitate popular YouTubers, but you need to understand that they're not trying to grow anymore because they already have a big audience. Instead, you should learn from smaller creators who are one step ahead of you. Look at their early work and see what they did to grow. It's better to learn from someone who has 1,000 or 10,000 subscribers in your niche, rather than someone with a million subscribers, because the gap is too big. Learning from someone closer to your level will be more relevant and achievable for you.<br><br><br><br>#19. it's important to realize that most of successful creators spent three to five years or even more to reach 100,000 subscribers. And for those with over a million subscribers, it often took five years or more to get there.<br><br><br><br>#20. A good strategy for gamers is to focus on a specific aspect of the game. For example, if you discover something in the game that a lot of people don't know about, that can be a great way to stand out. For instance, when Bijuu Mike played games like Hello Neighbor or Yandere Simulator on his channel, he often looked for secrets or glitches that he could share with his audience. It could be something as simple as a glitch that he found and showed others.<br><br><br><br>#21. New gamers and gamers in general often believe that playing a popular game is enough to get views, but that's not always true. You need to have an angle or something unique to offer to viewers. Many people don't realize this and just post their gameplay without any thought.<br><br><br><br>#22. My suggestion would be to not begin with vlogging. Instead, focus on creating searchable content that people can discover on their own. This is especially important if you're new to YouTube and haven't posted any videos yet. For instance, people are unlikely to search for something like "Day at the lake with friends".<br><br><br><br>#23. I don't think vlogging is the best way to initially build an audience. My recommendation is to strike a balance. Find what you're passionate about and create content around it, such as reviews, unboxings, and things people are actively searching for. Then, at the end of those videos, you can link to your more personal vlogs. Starting with vlogging can lead to getting stuck in a rut and only reaching a small audience of friends and family. Instead, focus on creating searchable content to reach a wider audience.<br><br><br><br>#24. For Sarah Ditschy going from zero to 4000 subscribers on YouTube was tough, but she found a way to create content that worked for her. Since she loved music, she would attend concerts, film them, and post the footage on YouTube the next day. She titled the videos with the artist's name and the venue, which helped them get a lot of views. This concert footage was what first brought in a couple of hundred subscribers. While people may not have come back to watch her vlogs or other content, it was still encouraging for her to have an audience watching and engaging with her videos.<br><br><br><br>#25. Try different types of content. If you usually make videos on one topic, try making videos on a related topic on a different day than usual. For instance, if you usually make makeup tutorials, choose a day to focus on fashion, hair or nails. If you're a gamer and typically do let's play videos, choose a day of the week for game reviews. Don't be afraid to experiment and see what works best. Posting it on a different day helps you prevent possible protests from your loyal fans expecting to see your usual videos at their usual times.<br><br><br><br>#26. Create not just individual videos but mini-series of videos to give your audience something to binge watch.<br><br><br><br>#31. When you are a beginner, creating videos about yourself such as celebrating subscriber milestones, updates, and behind-the-scenes videos are not worth your time (unless your niche is vlogging). At least, not until you reach a sizable audience that cares about you and not just your content.<br><br><br><br>#27. Create not just individual videos but mini-series of videos to give your audience something to binge watch.<br><br><br><br>#28. Focus on growing your Youtube channel instead of getting stuck on what you think your audience want. Always be thinking of new ways to grow your channel instead of being stuck on what you think your existing subscribers want.<br><br><br><br>#29. Make something about your content 1% better every time.<br><br><br><br>#30. The best way to learn how to create good content is to create a lot of content.<br><br><br><br>#31. Learn one new thing every time that you make a video.
<h3>Upload schedule</h3>
#15. Try posting at least one video every week. If you can do more, go for it, but only as long as the quality doesn’t suffer.<br><br><br>#16. Consistency in upload time isn't as crucial as creating good content. While sticking to a schedule has its benefits such as delivering on viewer expectations and getting into the habit of making videos, it won't affect your views in the long run. Quality should always come first, so if you need more time to perfect a video, take it. Your audience will appreciate it.<br><br><br>#17. Don't rush and upload lots of content all at once when starting out. Say, if you have 52 videos, your channel will grow more if you keep uploading a video a week all through the year than if you upload a video each day during the first 2 months and only upload sporadically after.<br><br><br><br>#32. When should you upload your videos? The answer is: as long as your audience is awake and available, you're good to go. For most creators, this means publishing their content around 4 or 5 PM Eastern Standard Time.<br><br><br><br>#33. We found that taking a break from YouTube for two weeks won't harm your channel much. However, if you take more than 30 days, it can become more challenging.<br><br><br><br>#34. Content creators who consistently upload one to three high-quality videos per week over a period of several years tend to be more successful than those who do not maintain this level of consistency. By high-quality videos we don't mean filming in 4K and using Hollywood class equipment, but videos that are of value for their audience.<br><br><br><br>#35. It's a popular myth that Youtube stops promoting your last video once you upload your next one.<br><br><br><br>#36. Build a backlog of videos. This ensures that you always have content ready to publish to maintain a regular upload schedule, even if life gets in the way.
<h3>Collaborations</h3>
#60. Collaboration is the second-fastest way to increase your viewership, just behind a viral video.<br><br><br>#61. Only approach the collaborators who align well with your niche. For example, if your channel is about learning foreign languages, don’t collaborate with a cooking channel.<br><br><br>#62. When searching for collaborators, look at channels your size first.<br><br><br>#63. If you want to collaborate with a larger or more successful youtuber, the most effective approach is to reach out to them with a request for an interview.<br><br><br>#64. When reaching out, don’t just copy and paste the same message to all the people on your list. Take some time to watch their content and make a personalized approach.<br><br><br><br>#65. The best way to become a person people want to collaborate with is by offering value to them. Deliver a top-notch interview, advertise their content and projects and then share the interview as much as you can.<br><br><br>#66. Attending events is an excellent way to find potential collaborators. Here is a small list of popular events to get you started: Beautycon, ComicCon, Playlist, Social Media Week, VidCon.<br><br><br><br>#37. Collaborating with people who are much bigger is often challenging. It's not because they care about your subscriber count, but because they may be too busy and already have a lot of friends or collaborators lined up.<br><br><br><br>#38. When asking someone to collaborate, don't make it the first conversation you've ever had with them. You should be genuinely interested in them and have had some prior conversation. Consider collaborating with someone who has fewer subscribers than you but still has an engaged audience. If you collaborate with someone who is much bigger than you, make sure your content is on par with theirs. If your production value or content quality is much lower than theirs, their audience may not be as interested in your content.<br><br><br><br>#39. Many people struggle to find collaborators for their YouTube channels. One reason for this is that they may not have enough content on their channel. Those who have less than 30 videos and are not consistent with their uploads may have trouble convincing other YouTubers to work with them. It is important to have a substantial amount of videos and upload content regularly, at least once a week or even multiple times a week. Other YouTubers may not see the benefit of investing their time in a collaboration with someone who has not put in the effort to build their own channel. It is easier for them to make a video for their own channel and have complete control over the content.<br><br><br><br>#40. If you want to collaborate with other YouTubers, start by reaching out to your friends and people you know. This is a good way to show others the collaboration videos you've done and how awesome they are, which can be your sales pitch for future collaborations.<br><br><br><br>#41. Collaborating with others can help grow your channel because it creates an association between you and the other person. This can lead to related video recommendations and higher search rankings on YouTube. Additionally, you can share each other's content on social media to expand your reach.<br><br><br><br>#42. To find people to collab with, check out your YouTube Dashboard. You can see who your subscribers are and even filter them by their subscriber count. Reach out to people who you think would be a good fit for a collaboration.<br><br><br><br>#43. Making fun of other YouTubers in a negative way can be harmful to both the YouTuber making the comments and the person or people they are making fun of. Here are a few reasons why:<br><br>    Damage to reputation: Making fun of other YouTubers can damage your own reputation and the reputation of the people you are targeting. Your audience may lose respect for you if they feel that you are being mean or unfair.<br><br>    Backlash: Making fun of other YouTubers may cause a backlash from their fans. This can lead to negative comments and dislikes on your videos, which can hurt your channel's growth.<br><br>    Legal issues: Making derogatory comments about someone else can lead to legal issues. If you make defamatory statements or accusations that are not true, you could be sued for slander or libel.<br><br>    Unprofessional behavior: Making fun of other YouTubers is generally considered unprofessional. It can make you appear petty and immature, which is not a good look for someone who is trying to build a brand and a following.<br><br>    Loss of potential collaboration: Making fun of other YouTubers can also lead to a loss of potential collaboration opportunities. Other YouTubers may not want to work with someone who has a history of making negative comments about their peers.<br><br>Overall, it is not a good idea to make fun of other YouTubers in a negative way. It can damage your reputation, lead to legal issues, and hurt your channel's growth. Instead, focus on creating positive and engaging content that showcases your unique voice and perspective.
<h3>Networking</h3>
#44. If you have friends who are also creators, form a network to share and promote each other's content.
<h3>Trends</h3>
#67. Creating videos about trending topics such as famous people and celebrities can be a great way to attract views and engage with a wider audience. Here are some examples of video ideas that capitalize on the popularity of celebrities and famous people:<br>1. Reacting to the latest celebrity news or gossip<br>2. Creating a makeup or fashion tutorial inspired by a celebrity's look<br>3. Doing a deep dive into the life and career of a famous person<br>4. Reviewing a movie or TV show that stars a popular celebrity<br>5. Collaborating with another YouTuber to do a fun challenge or game inspired by a celebrity<br>6. Creating a parody or satire video that pokes fun at a famous person or their recent actions.<br><br><br>#68. You can also leverage current events that are relevant to your industry.<br>Here are some examples of how to jump on current events in different industries:<br>1. Beauty and Fashion: Create content around red carpet looks and trends from major award shows, such as the Oscars or the Met Gala.<br>2. Technology: Cover major tech conferences and announcements, such as the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) or the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).<br>3. Sports: Discuss major sporting events, such as the Olympics, World Cup, or Super Bowl, and provide analysis or reactions.<br>4. Politics: Discuss and analyze major political events, such as elections, debates, and policy changes.<br>5. Food and Beverage: Cover major food festivals or events, such as the New York City Wine & Food Festival or the World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest.<br><br><br><br>#69. You can also leverage trending topics by creating content around popular songs or moments in pop culture. Here are some practical examples of how YouTubers can cover popular songs or pop culture moments:<br>1. React videos: Create a reaction video to a new music video release or a popular song. Share your thoughts and opinions on the song, the music video, and the artist.<br>2. Dance challenges: Create a dance challenge based on a popular song. Encourage your audience to learn the dance and share their own videos with you.<br>3. Parodies: Create a parody of a popular song or music video. Put your own spin on the lyrics and music video to make it unique and entertaining.<br>4. Lip-sync videos: Create a lip-sync video to a popular song. You can add your own twist to the video by incorporating costumes, props, or a unique setting.<br>5. Reviews: Create a review video of a new album or a popular song. Share your thoughts on the lyrics, the music, and the artist's overall performance.<br>6. Cover songs: Create a cover of a popular song. Put your own spin on the song to make it unique and showcase your own talents.<br>Remember to always respect copyright laws and make sure to properly credit the original artist.<br><br><br>#70. You can also take advantage of trends by featuring popular influencers in your content. Collaborate with an influencer, react to an influencer's content or discuss it in your own video, create content that parodies or satirizes an influencer's style or content. Examples of popular influencers: MrBeast, Shane Dawson, Dude Perfect, Casey Neistat.<br><br><br>#71. Be quick to embrace trends. Don’t wait for a trend to reach its peak.<br><br><br>#72. When hunting for trends, use Reddit, BuzzFeed, Google Trends and your competitors’ channels.<br><br><br><br>#45. Big Youtube channels were able to grow fast because of the Youtube algorithm. When a Youtube reviewer, drama, or news channel reports on a big Youtuber, they sometimes end up with a video related to that Youtuber's videos, which helps them get discovered and gain attention. Many of these channels have changed their original content to talk about big Youtubers because it is a fast way to grow on Youtube.
<h3>Tentpoles</h3>
#73. The tentpole strategy on YouTube means creating content around big events or topics that are relevant to your audience. This could include holidays, seasons, viral videos, popular songs, current movies, and events. By incorporating these trends into your content, you can take advantage of the increased exposure and momentum they bring. The most obvious tentpole events: New Year's Day, Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Easter, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas Day, Cyber Monday, Black Friday, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day. Also 10 examples of major cultural events that can become tentpoles: Super Bowl, Oscars, Grammy Awards, Cannes Film Festival, New York Fashion Week, Coachella, Comic-Con International, Art Basel, World Cup, Burning Man.<br><br><br>#74. When applying the tentpole strategy, be quick. Don’t wait until the Halloween night to upload your Halloween video. Do it weeks or even months in advance.<br><br><br>#75. Google Trends is a useful tool for tentpole strategy as it shows when people start searching for holidays, cultural events, and trends, when the searches peak, and when they drop off.
<h3>Searchable content</h3>
#29. As a new content creator, focus on creating search-based content. Make videos that answer questions or talk about popular topics that people are searching for. This makes it more likely that your videos will show up when people search on YouTube or Google. As you get more viewers and subscribers, you can start making different types of videos that your audience will enjoy.<br><br><br>#30. Use the YouTube search bar to find out what people are searching for. As you type in your query, you'll see a list of predictions that reflect what other people are searching for. To reach your target audience, check out these predictions and create content that addresses their queries and interests.<br>Let's say you have a cooking channel and you want to create a new video about making a classic Italian dish. You can use the YouTube search bar to find out what people are searching for related to that dish. When you type "how to make spaghetti carbonara" into the search bar, you might see predictions like "spaghetti carbonara without cream," "spaghetti carbonara with bacon," or "spaghetti carbonara with eggs only."<br>Based on these predictions, you could create a video that addresses each of these variations on the classic dish, providing recipes and cooking tips for each one. By doing this, you're creating content that directly addresses the questions and inquiries that people are already searching for on YouTube, increasing the chances that your videos will be discovered by a wider audience.<br><br><br>#46. Exploit high-search and low-competition topics. Use TubeBuddy for this.<br><br><br><br>#47. Search is a fantastic tool for new content creators. The reason it's so great is that if your content matches what people are searching for on YouTube, it becomes easier for them to find your videos. And when those people enjoy your content, it helps teach YouTube who your perfect audience is. In short, search helps connect you with the right viewers and improves your chances of success as a content creator.
<h2>Making videos</h2>
#14. Everyone's first video sucks. Yours will too. But that just means that you'll have a chance to learn a lot from it and make your second video better.
<h3>Equipment and Software</h3>
#18. When it goes for your content, equipment and production quality, always start with only what you have now and improve over time. As a beginner youtuber, using your smartphone camera will be just fine. MrBeast started with a broken smartphone and used it until he got 200,000 subscribers.
<h3>What is a Good Video?</h3>
#25. If you're a beginner, start with shorter videos (less than 10 minutes). Many viewers aren't ready to watch a long video without many views coming from a channel with few subscribers.<br><br><br><br>#27. The best way to go about making a video is:<br>- to have a big idea first<br>- to create a powerful title<br>- plan the possible thumbnail<br>- only start making a video as your last step<br><br><br><br>#28. To make a successful YouTube video, there are four important things you need to have:<br>1. A great concept or idea<br>2. An attention-grabbing opening (hook)<br>3. High-quality content that delivers on your idea<br>4. A quick and smooth transition to your next video<br><br><br><br>#48. Your videos should only be as long as necessary. If you can say the same things in a four-minute video instead of a six-minute video, then the perfect video length for that video is four minutes.
<h3>Coming up with Ideas for a Video</h3>
#32. Try asking your audience why they subscribed to you. Their answers could get you some ideas as to the type of content you should be making. You can ask your viewers directly in a video and collect their answers in comments or create a community post.<br><br><br><br>#49. Ask ChatGPT for video ideas. Here's the prompt: Give me 10 good video ideas for a youtube series on [insert niche here]. Each idea has to be unique and valuable to the viewer.<br><br><br><br>#50. Consider using Reddit to get ideas for your videos. Reddit has passionate communities with great conversation threads that can give you ideas for videos people care about. For example, if people are arguing about who would win a fight between two characters, like which Spiderman is better, that is something you could take advantage of. Channels like Death Battle have done this well by looking at things like Goku versus Superman.<br><br><br>#51. Look at your most performing videos for inspirational ideas.<br><br><br><br>#52. Collaborate with your audience by using their content. PewDiePie has a show called Meme Review where he features memes from his PewDiePie subreddit.<br><br><br><br>#26. Don’t set out to start making a video as soon as an idea pops up. Top YouTube creators often come up with multiple video ideas, create thumbnails for them, and then decide which ones are worth making. Oftentimes, only one out of five ideas gets made into a video. Although it may seem like a waste of time, it's actually a great way to make videos of great quality.<br><br><br><br>#53. Ask ChatGPT for some viral video ideas in your niche. It's actually quite good at it.
<h3>Hook (Video Intro)</h3>
#33. Don’t use any intro logos, don’t say “Hey guys, welcome back to my channel!” Instead, the first seconds of your video need to contain the strongest hook you can come up with. If your logo is so important to you or you have an unbearable urge to tell how your day was, you’ll have a chance to do it once you’re done with the hook.<br><br><br>#34. A hook is a powerful opening of a video that grabs the viewer's attention and makes them want to keep watching. Briefly tell the audience all the coolest things they are about to see while also highlighting some of the best clips from your video. To avoid the "bad movie trailer effect", try teasing the highlights instead of revealing everything at once.<br><br><br>#35. Not just the first seconds, but the first 3 minutes of a 12-15 min video is the most important part of your video. If you hook your audience in the first 3 minutes, it's likely they'll stay for much longer, if not till the end. The rest should still be of high quality, but the first three minutes are the most crucial. (Generally, consider the first 20-25 % of your video the most important.)<br><br><br>#36. Don't have a long talk about what you're going to do in the video, just get to it ASAP.<br><br><br><br>#54. Typically beginner content creators lose 30-50 % of their viewers within the first 30 seconds of the video.<br><br><br><br>#55. The first 8 seconds of your video are crucial to keep viewers engaged before they click off.<br><br><br><br>#56. Ask ChatGPT to improve your existing hook to a video or create a new one.<br><br><br><br>#57. To increase your reach and get more impressions on YouTube, focus on reducing the drop-off rate at the beginning of your content (first 30 seconds) to prevent people from leaving your videos right after clicking on them.
<h3>Core video</h3>
#37. Your every video has to deliver on the promise made in the title. For example, if your video’s title is "The simplest way to get rid of rodents", and you spend the entire video promoting a 500-dollar mouse trap, don’t expect your audience to be happy about it. Or<br>If you're making a video about creating a 10-story tall ice cream cone, you better show them that ice cream cone as soon as possible. At the very least, show the process of creating it, but definitely show clips of the final product towering above everything else.<br><br><br>#38. Use B-Rolls (extra footage) to keep viewers engaged. Make sure you have a license for each video clip.<br><br><br>#39. Choose video clips that focus specifically on the subject you want to showcase. Avoid using clips that have unnecessary elements or distractions in them. For instance, a close-up clip of a paintbrush stroke is more effective than a wide shot that includes a person painting with the brush.<br><br><br><br>#41. Use humor in your videos if possible, but never force it.<br><br><br><br>#58. When you're a beginner youtuber, talk less about yourself and more about your content. Be authentic, show your personality, but only in the context of your video's topic.<br><br><br><br>#59. Aim at over 50% of average viewer retention in your videos.<br><br><br><br>#60. What's more interesting to us, knowing what you ate today or how you lost 20 pounds in a month through your diet? The latter is more valuable because if we're trying to lose weight, we want to know what worked for you. Similarly, if you're playing a video game, do we want to watch you play or learn how to beat the boss level quickly? You could create a whole YouTube channel focused on beating video game bosses quickly. (c, rewritten by ChatGPT, examples are from R. Blake)<br><br>Sure! Here are some more examples of adding value to your content:<br><br>    Instead of just showing your outfit of the day, you can share tips on how to style the same outfit in different ways, or where to find affordable pieces similar to the ones you're wearing.<br><br>    Rather than just sharing a recipe, you can offer substitutions for certain ingredients to make it vegan or gluten-free, or give advice on how to make it healthier.<br><br>    Instead of just vlogging about your travels, you can provide recommendations for hidden gems in the places you visit, or tips on how to save money on flights and accommodations.<br><br>    Rather than just showing a makeup tutorial, you can share tips on how to make your makeup last all day, or how to create a certain look for different skin tones.<br><br>    Instead of just reviewing a product, you can compare it to similar products on the market, or share hacks on how to use it in different ways.
<h3>Ending a Video</h3>
#42. When your video is done with the core content, your final goal is to quickly direct the audience to another video on your channel. This can be a follow-up video, a next episode in the series, a deeper research on the same topic or simply a related video. The key task is to invite the viewers to explore your channel thus increasing the average view per viewer (AVPV).<br><br><br>#43. Don’t give your audience any hints that you’re finishing the video. They will evaporate the moment they sense that you’re done with the main content. Instead, your mission is to catch them while they’re still around and to direct them to your other videos so that they stay on your channel longer. Youtube appreciates that.<br><br><br><br>#61. Consider promoting just one video at your end screen instead of multiple. This usually increases the click-through rate on end screens by eliminating the confusion of choice.<br><br><br><br>#62. Videos that start and end abruptly often have higher viewer retention and fewer drop-offs. Therefore, it's worth considering eliminating long and unnecessary intros and outros from your videos.
<h3>Scripts</h3>
#63. An alternative to scripting may be bullet-pointed outline. You can have it on your smartphone.<br><br><br><br>#64. You can even ask ChatGPT to  come up with an entire script for your video based on the outline that you provide it with. Even the outline itself can be written by ChatGPT if you feed it with your video title.
<h3>Filming</h3>
#65. The best way to gain confidence when performing on camera is to practice, to make more videos.<br><br><br><br>#66. Make sure your video background is not distracting and makes sense. The scene sets the tone of the video and many people overlook this. At least clean your room as a bare minimum.<br><br><br><br>#67. When you mess up a word, snap three times to mark the mistake in the recording. Then, when you look at the audio wave form, you can easily find the mistake and edit it. By doing this, you can save time and avoid searching for errors in the footage repeatedly.<br><br><br><br>#68. To get a blurry background, use a wide aperture lens. It doesn't have to be expensive.<br><br><br><br>#69. Shoot at the highest possible resolution for more options and flexibility when editing, such as cropping and manipulating shots to appear as if taken from multiple camera angles.<br><br><br><br>#70. To make your videos look smooth, shoot at 30 or 60 frames per second. This will give you more realistic and smoother-looking footage.<br><br><br><br>#21. For recording your gameplay, tutorials, instructional videos and simply filming yourself use OBS. It's a free, powerful and highly customizable tool for youtubers of all levels.<br><br><br><br>Teleprompters are a popular tool for content creators on YouTube to help ensure that their messages are conveyed clearly and accurately. However, using a teleprompter can sometimes be obvious to viewers, which can distract from the content of the video. One way some creators attempt to conceal their use of a teleprompter is by moving their head around excessively while speaking. This makes it really difficult for viewers to track the eye movement of the speaker. Do it only if it fits your speaking style though.<br><br><br><br>#54. When filming yourself or recording your voice, smile and use facial expressions. It actually changes the tone of our voice, making it sound more natural, pleasant and friendly.<br><br><br><br>Don't film on your low-energy days.<br><br><br><br>Have ideas for your content well in advance before you start filming, so that you can shoot several sessions back to back when you have the opportunity.<br><br><br><br>To manage your time effectively, it's best to record your content when you have a quiet space available, especially if you have kids. Batch-recording during this time can save you time and help you create quality content. You can edit your videos at any time using headphones. When you're feeling exhausted, it's best to film and edit on your days off and handle admin tasks whenever you have free time after work.<br><br><br><br>If you have kids or not many opportunities to film when the house is quiet, it's important to take advantage of those moments. A good idea is to batch-record during those quiet times and edit later, when you have more flexibility to do so with headphones on. This also goes for recording voiceovers.<br><br><br><br>#52. Be sure to be well-rested and focused when shooting or recording.
<h4>Recording your voice</h4>
#71. Have the microphone as close to your mouth as possible.<br><br><br><br>#72. When you're outdoors or in an environment with a lot of reverb, it's recommended to use a dead cat or windscreen to reduce wind and outside noise interference. This is especially helpful in natural environments where wind and other noises are prevalent. If you're using a microphone indoors, it can also help cut down on noise from things like air conditioners or heaters.<br><br><br><br>#73. When using multiple audio sources or microphones, doing a clap at the beginning of filming can be helpful in syncing audio during post-processing.<br><br><br><br>#53. When speaking in your videos, try to sound as confident as you can.<br><br><br><br>#55. Everybody dislikes the sound of their recorded voice at first. The "trick" is to record your voice anyway and just ignore your initial feelings toward it. It can take a while before you get used to the sound of your voice in a recording, and you even might end up loving it after some time.<br>(There's a physical explanation of this phenomenon. When we speak, we hear our voice not only through the air, but also through the bones in our head, which vibrate and resonate with the sound. This creates a deeper, richer sound than what is actually recorded. When we listen to a recording of our voice, we only hear the sound through the air, and this can be quite different from what we are used to hearing.)<br><br><br><br>#74. Good audio quality is crucial for your recordings. If there is a lot of background noise, consider using a De-Noise filter. If you're dealing with reverb, a De-Reverb filter can help. Most professional editors have these filters available.<br><br><br><br>#75. Before you begin recording your main audio track or talking to the camera, it's a good idea to let the microphone capture some of the room tone and ambient noise for around 5-7 seconds. This will help you isolate unwanted sounds during post-processing and editing, resulting in cleaner sound overall.<br><br><br><br>#76. When recording a scripted video, practice reading the script out loud at least once before hitting the "Record" button.<br><br><br><br>#77. With scripted videos, if you have access to a teleprompter, use it. This will help you keep your eyes on the camera while delivering the lines
<h3>Editing</h3>
#78. If you do talking head videos, as an alternative to B-rolls, you can use slow horizontal camera pans, slow zoom ins, or jump zoom ins and outs. Also consider changing camera angles or switching from one camera to another in case you have more than one camera.<br><br><br><br>#79. Use info cards in a video at the moments when retention drops.<br><br><br><br>#80. If you use Green screen and color grade your videos, do color grading directly on your green screen footage before you cut it up. Doing it later will be much harder, as color correction will affect the footage on each video layer.<br><br><br><br>#81. When exporting your video from your software video editor, use "H.265". H.265, also known as High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), is a video compression standard that was developed to succeed the widely used H.264/AVC standard. H.265 is considered the best video codec available now because it offers significant improvements in video quality while using less data bandwidth compared to its predecessor.<br><br>One of the key benefits of H.265 is its ability to achieve the same level of video quality as H.264 but at a lower bit rate, resulting in smaller file sizes.<br><br><br><br>#82. Consider filming and exporting in 10bit to maximize video quality.<br><br><br><br>#83. When exporting standard HD 1080 video, choose video bitrate between 12 and 24 Mbps. Set your audio bitrate to 320 kbs.<br><br><br><br>#84. Learn the shortcut commands to the most frequently used operations in your favorite editing software.<br><br><br><br>#85. Do color correction to make sure that your skin tone looks accurate.<br><br><br><br>#86. You may want to prioritize giving your videos a cinematic look. It can make the video more visually appealing and engaging to the audience, add a sense of professionalism and quality to the content, finally it can help the video stand out from other content on the platform.<br><br><br><br>#87. By using presets, you can save time and effort instead of manually adjusting each setting for every video. You can utilize presets to become more efficient in various aspects of video production, such as color grading, audio processing, and video effects. Presets can be applied in video editing software such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, or Davinci Resolve. They can also be used in audio editing software like Adobe Audition or Audacity. Additionally, presets can be used in video effects plugins like Magic Bullet Looks or Red Giant Universe.<br><br><br><br>#88. Don't overuse transitions between clips in your videos. Apart from jump cuts, you might use L-cuts and J-cuts and occasionally a whip pan.<br><br>L-cuts and J-cuts are video editing techniques used to transition between clips in a more seamless and engaging way.<br><br>An L-cut refers to a situation where the audio from the previous clip continues playing over the footage from the next clip, creating an audio overlap that smooths the transition between the two clips. This technique is called an L-cut because the shape of the audio and video tracks in an editing timeline resemble the letter "L".<br><br>A J-cut, on the other hand, is the opposite of an L-cut. It's a situation where the audio from the next clip starts playing over the end of the previous clip, before the video from the next clip appears on the screen. This creates an audio transition that anticipates the change in visuals, making the transition feel more natural and smooth. The name "J-cut" comes from the shape of the audio and video tracks in the editing timeline, which resemble the letter "J".<br><br><br><br>#89. When it comes to editing, many youtubers are trying to be too fancy too soon. When you're starting out, it's best to stick with basic cuts and transitions.<br><br><br><br>#90. There are tasks that you don't need to watch over when working on videos, such as loading footage or rendering. You can set them up and do something else while they're happening, like editing another video or making a sandwich. It's important to prioritize and take advantage of these passive tasks to be more efficient with your time. Don't waste time watching these background tasks, use that time to do other work.<br><br><br><br>#19. Use the following video editing apps:<br>Android: InShot<br>iPhone/iPad: LumaFusion<br>Apple: iMovie<br>Windows: Adobe Premiere Pro<br><br><br><br>#20. DaVinci Resolve is the best free professional video editor.<br><br><br><br>#40. When editing, cut out all the boring and non-essential parts.
<h4>Sound</h4>
#91. Don't make the background music too loud.<br><br><br><br>#92. Viewers don't like bad audio in videos. They can tolerate some issues with lighting and camera focus, but bad audio is a big problem. "Bad audio" in YouTube videos refers to audio that is of poor quality, such as being too quiet, too loud, muffled, distorted, or containing distracting background noise.<br><br><br><br>#23. For sound editing, use Audacity. It's free, multi-platform, easy to use, has wide range of features (sound effects, noise recuction, sound equalization) and supports plugins and extensions.<br><br><br><br>#24. If you hear too much reverb when recording your voice, be sure to fix it. Having good quality sound in a Youtube video is crucial. Consider the following options:<br>- try finding a better placement for your microphone, keep it closer to your mouth<br>- use a dynamic microphone, they are designed to capture only the sound directly in front of them and avoid picking up background noise<br>- apply acoustic treatment to your room<br>- install Krisp to kill reverb on the fly<br>- cancel the reverb in post-production. We've seen the best results from iZotope RX software. Lots of folks seem to be happy with Adobe's AI-powered audio enhancer tool (https://podcast.adobe.com/enhance).
<h3>Music</h3>

<h4>Source of music</h4>
#93. YouTube provides the YouTube Audio Library, where creators can freely download music and sound effects for their videos. These tracks are copyright-safe for use on YouTube, so you won't face Content ID claims or affect monetization. It's important to note that some tracks require attribution, which means you need to give written credit in your video's description. These tracks are marked with a "CC" icon and you can easily copy the attribution text from the icon to paste it into your description.<br><br><br><br>#94. If you're part of the YouTube Partner Program, you can access Creator Music. It combines the YouTube Audio Library tracks and sound effects with a library of mainstream music that you can use in your videos without risking your monetization. When you filter by price, you can find free tracks. Icons indicate the usage terms for songs, such as buying a license upfront or sharing revenue with the artist. You can see if a track isn't available for licensing or revenue sharing, and using it may have restrictions on visibility or monetization of your video. You can download a track to test it with your content before purchasing a license.<br><br><br><br>#95. Epidemic Sound offers over 40,000 tracks and over 90,000 sound effects.
<h4>Copyright</h4>
#96. Please mind that using someone else's "copyright free" music comes with a risk because the owners can still copyright it in the future, which may result in a copyright strike on your videos.<br><br><br><br>#97. Simply giving credit to the copyright owner or using phrases like "All rights and credit for the music go to the original artist/creator", "I do not own the rights to the music in this video" or "No copyright infringement intended. All music rights belong to their respective owners." does not grant you permission to use copyrighted work. It can lead to your video being blocked, made ineligible for monetization or taken down completely.<br><br><br><br>#98. If you use someone else's copyrighted content in your video, like music playing in the background or even singing or playing part of a song on an instrument, you might still face copyright claims and your video could be taken down.<br><br><br><br>#99. Using any amount of someone else's copyrighted work, even a few seconds, without permission puts you at risk of receiving a claim or takedown. Just because similar videos exist on the site doesn't mean you have the right to post that content.
<h3>Thumbnails</h3>
#47. While a beginner, use Canva for thumbnails. It's a free tool that has tons of customizable templates for you to choose from.<br><br><br><br>#48. When you feel like you're outgrowing Canva, switch to Photoshop (or Gimp, which is the best free alternative to Photoshop).<br><br><br>#49. If you struggle coming up with effective thumbnails, take inspiration from the bigger players in your niche.<br><br><br><br>#100. Do A/B testing of your thumbnails. TubeBuddy is the most recommended tool for this.<br><br><br><br>#101. Use Photopea as a free web-based alternative to Photoshop and Gimp. Photopea has many features similar to Adobe Photoshop, such as layers, filters, and adjustment tools, but can be accessed through a web browser without requiring installation or a subscription fee.<br><br><br><br>#102. If you're unsure about which colors to combine and don't want to learn color theory or use a color wheel, there's a simple trick you can use. Look up different sports teams and their uniforms, and pay attention to their color pairings. You can steal those color pairings to know what colors to put together.<br><br><br><br>#103. When creating a thumbnail, don't put anything important into the lower right corner, as it's where YouTube puts the timestamp.<br><br><br><br>#104. Consider putting your face in your thumbnails. YouTube says that thumbnails with a face statistically get more clicks.<br><br><br><br>#105. If you have a logo, put in in your thumbnail.<br><br><br><br>#106. Remember, thumbnails can be changed whenever you want. You can modify and adjust them if you feel the need to do so. You may also want to update some of your older thumbnails at some point.<br><br><br><br>#107. Use short and simple text on your thumbnail, ideally 1-5 words.<br><br><br><br>#108. Consider scaling your thumbnails down to 120x90 and check if they still look good.<br><br><br><br>#109. Successful thumbnails have something intriguing about them.
<h3>Titles</h3>
#44. Look at your competitors' channels for successful title ideas.<br><br><br>#45. Embrace clickbait titles because guess what? It works. It was considered very annoying several years ago, but now it's pretty much widely accepted. "Clickbait" is fine as long as the title doesn't lie about the content of the video. Stay away from truly cringy clickbait though. Bad clickbait titles: "You won't believe what happens next!", "AMAZING trick to get rich quick!", "Breaking news: [Celebrity name] is dead!". Good clickbait titles: "I tried a 24-hour no sleep challenge and this is what happened!", "10 easy tips to improve your cooking skills", "Learning French in 30 days: My progress and tips".<br><br><br><br>#46. How can you come up with a good clickbait title? Learn from your biggest competitors, most likely they are using it. Or ask ChatGPT for help, by giving it the following command: "Generate a clickbait title for my YouTube video based on this title: [insert title here]".<br><br><br><br>#110. If you have a video with a current year in title, like "The best way to start a YouTube channel in 2023" and this video performs well, consider renaming it to "The best way to start a YouTube channel in 2024" once the year 2024 begins. It's also wise not to actually pronounce the word "2023" in your video as this is gonna be much harder to update later.<br><br><br><br>#111. Titles that start with "How to" simply do not work on YouTube anymore. You need to come up with a much catchier title to grab audience's attention.<br><br><br><br>#112. Ask ChatGPT to help you make better titles for your videos. Here is an example for you. The prompt: "My youtube video title is "How to start a YouTube channel in 2023". Give me 5 more clickable variations of this title." These are possible generated results:<br>1. "10 Steps to Starting a Successful YouTube Channel in 2023"<br>2. "The Ultimate Guide to Launching Your YouTube Channel in 2023"<br>3. "New to YouTube? Here's How to Get Started in 2023"<br>4. "2023 YouTube Channel Creation: Tips and Tricks for Beginners"<br>5. "From Zero to YouTube Hero: Starting Your Channel in 2023"<br>Looks much more appealing, doesn't it?<br><br><br><br>#113. You can use ChatGPT to improve the titles of your previous under-performing videos. Mr. Beast frequently updates the titles and thumbnails of his old videos to appeal to his current audience.<br><br><br><br>#114. If you are in the letsplay niche and you name your video like "Let's Play: Game X - Part 12", that's the most terrible thing you can do. Nobody watches that.
<h3>Descriptions</h3>
#115. The best example of effective and nice-looking description to a video that we've seen so far is Roberto Blake's videos. Here's a link for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40RjvxRX1H8<br><br><br><br>#116. You can easily update descriptions to hundreds of videos at once using TubeBuddy's find and replace tool. This allows to add or change links to your own website or Amazon Affiliate, among other things.
<h3>Chapters</h3>
#117. If you're making a 10 things... or 5 things... video and creating chapters, don't give away those things in your chapter titles.
<h3>Uploading videos</h3>
#22. Always upload at 1080p.<br><br><br><br>#118. Youtube absolutely doesn't care how you name a video file or a thumbnail file that you upload. Don't even bother putting your best keywords in the titles of those filenames, it won't help you promote your content.
<h3>Productivity Tips</h3>
#50. Start with simple videos. If you have a lot of other things going on in your life, like a job, family, or school, it's better to create simple videos than to not create videos at all. Start with "talking head" videos and build up gradually, as you become more comfortable with content creation and have more time to dedicate to it.<br><br><br>#51. Try to come up with the title and thumbnail idea before you start filming and not the other way around.<br><br><br><br>#56. Always be batch producing content. When you’re filming, shoot two videos at once. When making thumbnails, do it for several videos. This is the biggest productivity advice we can give you.<br><br><br>#57. With each new video that you make, improve something.<br><br><br><br>#119. Don't confuse consistency with quantity and value with quality.<br><br><br><br>#120. If you have a regular nine-to-five job, filming or editing your content right after work may not be the best option for you, as you may not have the necessary mental and emotional energy. During this time, it's better to spend your energy on smaller tasks that take only 45 minutes to an hour, such as creating thumbnails, conducting research, or handling administrative work. When you're tired after work, you may not be able to make good judgments on your edits or give your best performance on camera.<br><br><br><br>#121. If you have kids or not many opportunities to film when the house is quiet, it's important to take advantage of those moments. A good idea is to batch-record during those quiet times and edit later, when you have more flexibility to do so with headphones on. This also goes for recording voiceovers.<br><br><br><br>#122. To manage your time effectively, it's best to record your content when you have a quiet space available, especially if you have kids. Batch-recording during this time can save you time and help you create quality content. You can edit your videos at any time using headphones. When you're feeling exhausted, it's best to film and edit on your days off and handle admin tasks whenever you have free time after work.<br><br><br><br>#123. Keep your assets organized. Assets are any media files such as images, videos, audio clips, graphics, pre-made intro and outro clips and more that you use to make videos. This can be achieved by creating clear and organized folder structures, naming files consistently, and using tags and keywords to quickly filter and locate specific assets.<br><br><br><br>#124. Make something about your content 1% better every time.<br><br><br><br>#125. The best way to learn how to create good content is to create a lot of content.<br><br><br><br>#126. Learn one new thing every time that you make a video.<br><br><br><br>#127. You can't film when there's a lot of noise around you. However, you can perfectly edit in any possibly environment.<br><br><br><br>#128. Backup everything.<br><br><br><br>#129. If you're busy with school, work, or family, start your channel with easy and simple content. Create as much content as you can and do your best until you have more time to dedicate to it. Also, wait until you know it's worth putting in more effort. Consider this as your foundation.<br><br><br><br>#130. Don't aim for perfection, as it can be harmful. Just getting a task done is more important than doing it perfectly. Don't let the pursuit of perfection hinder your progress.<br><br><br><br>#131. Make sure that when you're creating your videos, you're in a good state both physically and mentally. Ensure that you're not hungry or thirsty and that you have plenty of energy. This will translate to your audience and impact how they perceive you.
<h4>Outsourcing</h4>
#132. Many daily vloggers follow a process where they shoot their footage throughout the day and then send it to an editor who is in a different time zone. While you sleep, the editor begins their workday and sends the edited footage back to you by the time you wake up. Platforms like Fiverr make this process convenient because you can choose an editor from anywhere in the world. This approach is popular among daily vloggers as it allows for quick and efficient turnaround, ensuring that their vlogs are uploaded the following day.<br><br><br><br>#133. When looking for a freelance video editor, go after someone having experience in your niche.
<h3>Analytics</h3>
#58. Checking how well your YouTube channel is doing is important. Even more so is doing it right. The wrong way to do it is hit the "NewTubers" subreddit and write a post: "Hey guys. I started my channel a week ago. I have 4 videos, 38 views and 5 subs. How am I doing?" In most cases you just get shoulder tapped and encouraged to continue your grind. Here's the right way to do it:<br>Take some time and find 5 or more active YouTube channels that do absolutely the same thing as you're doing and that have give or take the same number of subscribers. Every 2-4 weeks compare your channel's performance against theirs. If you're gaining more average views and subscribers than them, you're fine. If you're the outsider, learn from them like crazy.<br><br><br>#59. When examining the analytics of your videos, pay most attention to:<br>- click-through rate (CTR)<br>- retention rate.<br>CTR measures how many viewers click on your video's thumbnail or title and start watching the video, compared to how many times the video has been shown to viewers.<br>If your video has a high CTR, YouTube is more likely to recommend it to new potential viewers. If your video has a weak title, topic, or thumbnail, it can result in a lower CTR, which reduces the chances of your video's success.<br>To get more viewers, it's crucial to create an attractive and attention-grabbing topic, title, and thumbnail for your video. If these elements fail to pique the viewers' interest, they are less likely to click on your video, and as a result, YouTube will not recommend your video to other potential viewers. <br>Retention rate measures how long viewers watch your videos.<br><br><br><br>#134. When it comes to your video stats, it may seem strange that better videos often have lower stats. The reason for this is that as a video performs better, it reaches a larger audience with different viewing experiences. This can affect various stats.<br><br>For example, if your video has very low impressions, it's easier to achieve a high click-through rate (10-15%) because the few people who see it are more likely to click. Similarly, if a video has only 10 views but receives positive feedback, it's a good sign that it might attract more views in the future.<br><br>However, things get more complex when your videos start reaching a broader audience. Different viewers interact with your content in various ways, which can affect your stats in unpredictable ways. In your analytics, you may notice that your best-performing videos have lower retention or click-through rates. This can be confusing if you don't understand how YouTube works.<br><br>To summarize, the issue isn't that your content isn't good enough or that YouTube won't show it to others based on your stats alone. The problem is that your videos weren't competitive enough at that point to be shown to a larger audience. For instance, I have a video on my channel with under a minute of watch time but millions of views. However, as you scale up your views, the same principles apply. The better you can maintain high stats as your videos reach more people, the better the audience response will be.<br><br><br><br>#135. If you notice an increase in returning viewers and an increase in average views per viewer, it means that your channel is healthy and experiencing growth.
<h2>Promoting videos</h2>
#76. Don't buy ads from Youtube to promote your videos. Even though they often work, the effect is never long-term and they are never worth the money you'll spend on them. It's only recommended to buy advertising when you're selling a product, offering a service, or have built your brand to a certain level where it makes sense.<br><br><br><br>#86. If possible, come up with a special name for your community. PewDiePie calls his fans “bros”. Gary Vaynerchuk calls his audience “Vayniacks”. Your viewers will love it.<br><br><br><br>#87. Ask your viewers for ideas for your next video, create content based on their suggestions, and give them a shoutout at the beginning of the video by naming actual names. Nothing will make your audience feel more encouraged, surprised and happy than this.<br><br><br><br>#88. Don’t waste time promoting your channel on other social media. Trying to send traffic from Instagram, Facebook or TikTok to Youtube is plain ineffective. Even if some users click on your Youtube videos, they only usually watch several seconds of the content which ruins average view duration (AVD) and results in Youtube recommending your videos much less.<br><br><br>#89. If you actively comment on Reddit, be sure to link your Youtube channel in your profile.<br><br><br>#90. Focus on what's working well on your YouTube channel and build upon it.<br><br><br><br>#136. Youtube is great for content but not so much for communication with fans. So choose ONE other platform to keep in touch with your fans.<br><br><br><br>#137. Talk to people that are interested in the same thing that you are. Don't ask them what they think about your last video. Ask them what they think about the things you said in your last video. You can find those people on Reddit, Twitter, Facebook.<br><br><br><br>#138. Ask your viewers to share your videos on social media.<br><br><br><br>#139. When promoting your videos on facebook or Reddit, ask the administrator if you can share a video occasionally.<br><br><br><br>#140. The initial views and watch time that your videos receive in the first 48 hours are crucial for your channel's success on YouTube. This is evident when you check your real-time analytics on the YouTube dashboard, as it only counts the first 48 hours.<br><br><br><br>#141. According to a study by pex.com, most YouTube videos (90%) receive fewer than 1,000 views, while only a tiny fraction (less than 1%) of videos generate more than 80% of the total views.
<h3>YouTube algorithm</h3>
#142. The YouTube algorithm or simply "the algorithm" is the system that decides which content to recommend and show to users. It takes into account their preferences, viewing history, and engagement patterns.<br><br><br><br>#143. As a small YouTuber, you should know a simplified version of the algorithm. There are three important things that even Mr. Beast focuses on: getting people to click on a video, getting them to watch it as long as possible, and getting them to watch more of your videos.<br><br><br><br>#144. YouTube recommends videos based on what you watch, how long you watch it, and how often you watch it, not just that video, but the topic too. The algorithm is driven by YouTube's topics and classifiers, and it's all based on your behavior. This is evident when you look at your YouTube homepage, which shows videos from the last 100 things you watched, whether or not you are subscribed to the channel. Even if you haven't subscribed to a channel, if you watch a few of their videos in a row or a longer video, YouTube will likely recommend more of their content to you.<br><br><br><br>#145. Let me simplify that for you. If you watch a lot of different YouTubers and subscribe to various channels, the ones you watch most often will get recommended to you. For instance, if you watch Philip DeFranco every day, YouTube will suggest more of his videos to you. However, if you don't watch a channel for some time, YouTube may stop recommending it to you.<br><br><br><br>#146. YouTube's algorithm doesn't search for viewers for your videos. It uses different methods to predict which videos you might watch based on your watch history, search history, viewing habits, how long you watch a video, and your interaction with specific creators. YouTube's algorithm also considers the viewing habits of people like you, who watch similar types of videos and are subscribed to similar channels. This profiling determines what videos you see on the homepage, in suggested videos, and below videos on mobile devices. Subscribers don't play a big role in this process, and user preferences dominate the platform. Many popular YouTubers claim that subscriber counts don't matter because their views and videos aren't reaching their subscribers.<br><br><br><br>#147. The YouTube algorithm looks at how many views a video gets in the first 24 to 72 hours. So if a video gets more views in the first few days, YouTube sees it as engaging and ranks it higher in search results.<br><br><br><br>#148. Many people think that YouTube promotes specific content and creators, but this is completely inaccurate. The truth is that YouTube operates more as a pull system than a push system. In other words, YouTube prioritizes the viewers rather than the content creators.<br><br>Here's how it works: When you publish a video on YouTube, if there are viewers on the platform who might be interested in your content, YouTube will "pull" that content and present it to those viewers. YouTube doesn't actively promote every video that is published. So, it's not a situation where you upload a video and YouTube immediately promotes it to everyone.<br><br>Moreover, there is no favoritism on YouTube. The algorithm itself doesn't have preferences or opinions about our content. Instead, it relies on how users interact with the content. This is crucial to understand, especially for new content creators. The algorithm follows the audience's response.<br><br>If people respond positively to your content, YouTube will show it to more people. On the other hand, if people aren't engaging with your content, such as not clicking on it or not continuing to watch after clicking, YouTube will prioritize videos that are getting better activity. This means it's vital to focus on creating a positive viewer experience because there are no tricks or shortcuts to deceive the YouTube algorithm.<br><br><br><br>#149. Youtube's goal is to find the right video for a viewer, not to find viewers for your videos.
<h3>Comments</h3>
#83. Always ask people to leave comments on your videos.<br><br><br>#84. When your channel is small, respond to every single comment on your videos. Most of you won't receive many comments anyway. As you grow bigger, be sure to at least answer every question that people ask you in comments. Even when you become famous, consider answering personally to everyone who leaves a meaningful comment in the first few hours after the video is published. Every person that you reply to with more than just "thanks" could become your potential subscriber.<br><br><br><br>#85. Don’t give too much weight to comments under your videos such as “Nice video”, “It was really helpful”, “You deserve more subs”. Everybody gets them and they mean nothing. Only trust the objective data from Youtube analytics. Your video is nice only if it receives a nice amount of views. Your content was only then really helpful to people if your video showed a retention of 50% or higher. You only deserve more subs if you’re getting a lot of subs.<br><br><br><br>#150. To fight scammers, consider blocking links from your comment section.<br><br><br><br>#151. Put banned words into your community settings.<br><br><br><br>#152. Don't spam other people's videos with comments asking them to come to your channel, watch your videos, or do sub for sub. This will only turn people off, and many content creators usually ban and block those people from commenting again.<br><br><br><br>#153. When dealing with negative people like trolls and haters, your best options are: ignore them, block them, ban them, report them, or delete their comments.<br><br><br><br>#154. If someone keeps harassing you, report them so they won't bother you anymore and won't bother others either.
<h3>Community tab</h3>
#155. Once you hit 500 subscribers, you get access to the Community tab.<br><br><br><br>#156. Be sure to promote your most profitable videos and playlists in the Community tab on your channel.
<h3>Subscribers</h3>
#157. There are five different types of Play Buttons that YouTube gives to creators for reaching certain milestones:<br><br>    Silver Play Button for 100,000 subscribers<br>    Golden Play Button for 1 million subscribers<br>    Diamond Play Button for 10 million subscribers<br>    Custom Play Button for 50 million subscribers<br>    Red Diamond Play Button for 100 million subscribers<br><br>Each button is made of different materials, with unique designs and features. Currently, only a few channels have received the Custom and Red Diamond Play Buttons. The Red Diamond Play Button is the most prestigious award, and only five channels have achieved it so far.<br><br><br><br>#158. According to the statistics, 90 % of youtubers never reach 10,000 subscribers.<br><br><br><br>#159. MKBHD had 74 subscribers after 100 videos, MrBeast had around 780 subscribers after his first 100 videos, and PewDiePie, who now has over 100 million subscribers, had only 2,500 subscribers after his first 100 videos.<br><br><br><br>#160. According to Roberto Blake's research, on average, creators need to make about 800 videos to reach 100,000 subscribers and earn a silver play button. To earn a gold play button, they need to make well over 1,000 videos on average.<br><br><br><br>#161. According to TubeBuddy and Roberto Blake, "on average, it usually takes most content creators about roughly five years in order to get to 10,000 subscribers on YouTube". Some of the reasons of this:<br>- people have a full-time job and can't fully commit to making videos<br>- people have families<br>- people have kids to take care of<br>A lot of content creators who managed to grow very fast were young and didn't have a full-time job.<br><br><br><br>#162. Most of youtubers get less than half of all views from their subscribers.<br><br><br><br>#163. YouTube only sends your video to people who have notifications on and your most engaged subscribers. If viewers skip or don't watch your videos multiple times, YouTube stops showing them your content, even if they're subscribed to your channel. This doesn't mean you're a bad creator, as even popular channels can have low views on some videos due to audience preferences and the YouTube algorithm. For example, some channels with millions of subscribers in the business niche may only get a few thousand views per video, but this is normal. YouTube wants to show viewers the content they're most likely to watch, as it generates more revenue.<br><br><br><br><br>#164. Get more views, and you will get more subscribers.<br><br><br><br>#165. If your Youtube channel is focused on a specific topic, like a Pokemon Go channel, most of your subscribers will watch your videos and likely subscribe. That's why many people create niche channels on Youtube.<br><br><br><br>#166. Many creators don't realize that views are the key to gaining subscribers. If your videos aren't getting enough views, it's impossible to get more subscribers. That's why it's important to focus on maximizing views on your videos.<br><br><br><br>#77. When starting out at zero subscribers, suppress your desire to ask all your family, friends and colleagues to become your first followers. Believe me, your mom is not your target audience. (Unless she actually is into gameplay or whatever you're doing!) If your subscribers aren't interested in your videos, they won't watch them. YouTube will see low click-through rates and assume the videos aren't good, which will harm their visibility. Even if they watch a bit to support you, low view retention can also hurt your video.<br><br><br><br>#78. Don't do sub4sub. Sub4Sub means subscribing to someone's channel in exchange for them subscribing to yours. This method is a quick way to gain new subscribers and isn't against Youtube's policies. On the other hand, this won't make your channel truly grow, as you end up with people who don't watch your videos. Overusing this method leads to a false sense of success.<br><br><br>#79. Definitely stay away from third-party sites that sell or exchange subscribers. Everything in the previous tip applies here, but this actually IS against Youtube's rules and is easily detectable. This can get your channel terminated.<br><br><br>#80. Always ask your viewers to subscribe to your channel. Statistically, content creators who remind their audience to subscribe in every video tend to have larger subscriber base.<br><br><br><br>#81. Don’t ask your viewers to subscribe at the very beginning of your videos. Don’t just say: “Please subscribe to my channel”. Only ask to subscribe once your video has provided your audience with enough value to justify subscription. Also always tell your viewers what they’re going to get out of subscription. Example: “If you found this video helpful, remember to subscribe to my channel so you can see all of my new recipe videos every week.”<br><br><br>#82. Thank your viewers for following you. In the course of your video say something like: "Thanks a lot for 16 subscribers. You're amazing!"<br><br><br><br>#167. Usually the number of subscribers a channel has is about 1 % of their overall view count. So, if you have accumulated 100,000 views, most likely your channel has 1000 subscribers. We can call it a "1 % rule".<br><br><br><br>#168. Once you get 100,000 subscribers, you get a Silver Play Button.<br><br><br><br>#169. If you've already grown several hundred subscribers and your goal is to grow your subscriber base even more, find your top 10 videos that you brought you the most subscribers and make more videos like that. Also promote those most performing in terms of subscribers videos in your other videos. Use end screens and the Community tab.<br><br><br><br>#170. When someone subscribes to your YouTube channel, it doesn't mean that they will immediately have your every new video recommended to them on the YouTube homepage. It's more complicated than this and it really depends on how much of your content they watch and if they watch it to completion. YouTube wants people to stay on their platform for as long as possible. If your subscribers aren't really invested in your channel, YouTube would rather recommennd them other videos on the homepage. It hasn't worked that way since at least 2015.<br><br><br><br>#171. Don't stress out over losing subscribers all of a sudden for no apparent reason. YouTube periodically removes inactive, closed, bot and spam accounts. This can lead to a decrease in the total number of your subscribers.<br><br><br><br>#172. According to TubeFilter, on average, it takes about 22 months to reach 1,000 subscribers on YouTube.
<h3>Playlists</h3>
#173. Use playlists to share videos on social media. Instead of just sharing one video, share a link to the playlist with that video as the first one. If people like that video, they can keep watching more from the playlist. This increases YouTube session watch time, which is important to improve rankings on YouTube.<br><br><br><br>#174. Put playlists instead of individual videos on your websites and blogs that you own or manage. You can also do this on platforms like Medium, a blogging site, and Tumblr, among others.<br><br><br><br>#175. Put your best videos at the beginning of the playlist, and the less good ones at the end, except cases when the videos need to be watched in a specific order.<br><br><br><br>#176. Place your most popular or relevant playlists at the top of the page, this helps attract and retain viewers.<br><br><br><br>#177. If you have a series of related videos or playlists, you may want to group them together so that viewers can easily find all of the content related to that topic.
<h2>Making money on YouTube</h2>
#178. To increase your earnings, it's important to choose a niche that pays well. For example, finance is one of the most viewed niches on YouTube and has one of the highest CPMs on the platform.<br><br><br><br>#91. Don’t even think about money within the first months of your journey. Instead, always remember that you will be making a lot of money in the long run once you grow true fans loyal to your channel or your product.<br><br><br><br>#179. Don't join MCNs. MCNs (Multi-Channel Networks) are third-party companies that provide services to YouTube content creators. These services can include video production, marketing and promotion, audience development, content strategy, monetization, and more. MCNs often offer creators access to tools, resources, and expertise that can help them grow their channels and maximize their earnings. In exchange, MCNs typically take a percentage of the revenue generated by the content creators they represent. While MCNs were once a popular way for creators to monetize their content and grow their channels, the rise of YouTube's own monetization features and other third-party tools has led to a decline in the importance of MCNs in the YouTube ecosystem. MCNs were helpful back in the day, when gaming channels couldn't get into the partnership program and joining an MCN was their only chance to see any ad revenue. As a downside of it, MCNs took up to half of their earnings. Even PewDiePie with 30,000 subscribers could only earn money on YouTube through an MCN.<br><br><br><br><br>#95. Use your channel to sell your own products or services. When you sell your own product, you get to keep all of the money you make instead of just a small percentage. This method is especially beneficial for small youtubers, as it has the potential to generate revenue for you even with a relatively small number of subscribers and views. Here’s a small list of what you can be offering just to get your creativity started: Handmade crafts or products (jewelry, home décor), Digital products (printables, digital art), personalized services (editing, graphic design services), recipe or cooking guides (e-books, meal plans); DIY tutorials or guides (home renovation, car repair guides), workout plans or fitness coaching services, music or audio tracks for use in videos or podcasts, beauty or skincare products (homemade soap, lip balm), personalized merchandise (custom-made t-shirts, stickers), photography or videography services (event or portrait photography), foreign language guides or tutoring.<br><br><br>#96. If you own a physical business, you can use YouTube as a way to promote it to people outside your area. For example, if you own a store, you can create videos that showcase that store and what you sell, and use YouTube to reach people around the world. Although you won't make money directly from the videos, you can use them to bring in more customers to your store and increase your revenue.<br><br><br><br><br>#99. Set up a Patreon account to let your fans support you. Provide your patreons with exclusive content once a month.<br><br><br><br>#180. Surrounding yourself with like-minded people can be helpful for feedback and connections. These connections can even lead to brand deals, freelance clients, and part-time employees when you need them.<br><br><br><br>#181. Some of the most profitable niches on Youtube:<br>- car and automotive<br>- outdoor and adventure<br>- marketing<br>- photo and video gear<br>- eCommerce<br>- productivity<br>- tutorials<br>- podcasting<br><br><br><br>#182. Best 6 profitable niches for making money online<br>- creator economy<br>- family and lifestyle<br>- saas<br>- news and current events (incl. podcasting)<br>- online education<br>- design and branding<br><br><br><br>#183. Most profitable niches on Youtube:<br>- ecommerce, personal finance<br>- tech channels<br>- lifestyle<br>- real estate<br>- software tutorials<br><br><br><br>#184. But on Skillshare, you stand to make about three to eight cents per minute watched.<br><br><br><br>#185. Skillshare pays 3 to 8 cents per minute watched. Skillshare has the same business model as Netflix, but in the education niche.
<h3>Ad revenue</h3>
#186. Consider removing non-skippable ads because they don't necessarily pay more and can turn off your audience, causing them to stop watching your videos.<br><br><br><br>#187. Focus on promoting the videos that generate the highest revenue. To identify them in YouTube Analytics, Click on the Revenue option in the top menu. You will now see a list of all your videos with their corresponding revenue for the selected time period. You can sort the list by revenue to see which videos are bringing in the most money.<br><br><br><br>#188. A good strategy is to create playlists and themes around your top-earning content. Instead of promoting individual videos, promote these profitable playlists. By creating binge-worthy loops around these videos, you increase the chances of them being picked up, promoted, and distributed by YouTube. This could lead to even more views and engagement, as YouTube promotes content that is receiving attention. By optimizing both your valuable videos and profitable playlists, you can improve their searchability on YouTube, especially if you create evergreen content.<br><br><br><br>#189. Make more videos similar to your most profitable videos, based on their CPM and RPM rates.<br><br><br><br>#190. If your video is shorter than eight minutes, YouTube won't put mid-roll and post-roll ads on it. To get more chances for ad placement without ruining the viewer's experience, you could consider creating an extended version of the video on the same topic or theme.<br><br><br><br>#191. After your content is approved for ads, they won't automatically start paying you. You have to manually turn on ads for your videos in the moderation dashboard and select all your previous videos to turn monetization on for them too, so you can start earning from them. Many people forget to do this step and then wonder why they are not earning money.<br><br><br><br>#192. The main issue with fair use is often with movie/TV show reviews and game play videos, mostly due to music licensing. To avoid this, you can turn off background music in the game settings, since you might have permission for the game footage, but not for the music.<br><br><br><br>#193. If you are monetized, consider not putting ads in the middle of your videos if you want to grow.<br><br><br><br>#194. Ad revenue isn't the most reliable way of income.<br><br><br><br>#195. Usual place for a manually placed mid-roll videos is where you are not talking in a video.<br><br><br><br>#196. Post your most performing video in terms of monetary income to your Community tab as a classic but timeless piece of content. After you review your most successful and profitable videos, create similar content to them. If a specific video earned a lot of money regardless of views, you can likely get similar ad placements and frequency on content that is similar. This is because YouTube and its ad system try to match advertisers with relevant content. Therefore, if a video already matched for high paying ads, create more content that can match with those ads. It's important to note that not all videos and ads are the same, as different ads play on different videos based on various factors like genre, category, and season. Keep this in mind when creating content.<br><br><br><br>#197. Stop cursing in your videos. Using curse words on the platform reduces the number of ads you can qualify for because some advertisers avoid certain types of content. Content that has bad words in the first 8 seconds of it is not monetizable.<br><br><br><br>#198. Just because someone watches your video doesn't mean they'll see an ad. Usually, YouTubers only get an ad view for about 30% of their total views.<br><br><br><br>#199. It's a good idea to include a commercial break every 8 to 12 minutes. By this point, many viewers will start to lose interest, so it's similar to what happens in TV shows.<br><br><br><br>#93. Don’t rely just on the ad money from Youtube Partnership Program. Use affiliate marketing, brand deals, merchandise and other streams of income. Not only it increases your income, but also makes it more stable.<br><br><br><br>#200. Entertainment channels usually can't boast about having good CPMs. It's normal for them to have 1,000,000 views and only get 500 or 1,000 dollars in ad revenue, even if they regularly manage to make viral videos.<br><br><br><br>#201. Besides ad revenue, YPP gives other ways to make money, like channel memberships, live stream Super Chat and Super Stickers, a merchandise shelf, and a share of the YouTube Premium subscribers' fee when they watch your content.
<h4>Applying for monetization</h4>
#92. Once your channel hits one thousand subscribers and four thousand hours of watch time over a period of 12 months, apply for Youtube Partnership Program to be able to receive a share of the ad revenue.<br><br><br><br>#202. It's important to create your Google AdSense account before applying for the YouTube Partner Program. To receive direct deposits, you'll need to provide your bank account and routing number.<br><br><br><br>#203. The more original content you have on your channel, the higher are your chances to be approved into the monetization program. Be very careful when using other youtuber's content, when uploading content from other platforms like TikTok or uploading movie or TV show footage. Avoid taking unnecessary risks at least until you're monetized.<br><br><br><br>#204. For monetization, only the watch time needs to be accumulated over the period of the last 12 months.<br><br><br><br>#205. Creating YouTube Shorts won't help you meet the requirements to join the YouTube Partner Program and earn money from YouTube as they don't contribute to your watch time total.<br><br><br><br>#206. If you do a 24-hour or 24/7 live stream, it won't count towards the public watch time required to qualify for monetization. This is because it never really ends and doesn't get published.<br><br><br><br>#207. Unlisted and deleted videos also don't count toward the qualified watch time for YouTube monetization. Only public videos matter.<br><br><br><br>#208. If a channel is denied when applying for YPP (YouTube Partner Program) for the first time, they will have 21 days to appeal or wait for 30 days before they can reapply. If the channel reapplies after 30 days and gets rejected again, they will still have 21 days to appeal but will need to wait for 90 days before they can reapply. That seems reasonable. If your channel is rejected twice, it suggests that there are fundamental issues with meeting the monetization policies. YouTube doesn't want to invest time in repeat applicants who have a low chance of being accepted into the YouTube Partner Program when there are new applicants who are more likely to be accepted.
<h3>Sponsorships</h3>
#97. Don’t wait for sponsors to reach out to you. Reach out to them! Even if your channel only has 1500 subscribers.<br><br><br>#98. Only have brand deals with sponsors whose product is appropriate for your audience. For example, if you’re a children’s toy channel, don’t promote alcohol beverages.<br><br><br><br>#209. Only start looking for sponsors when your channel hits 1000 subscribers. Before that companies will see little benefit sponsoring you.<br><br><br><br>#210. The easiest way to find sponsors is to ask other youtubers for the emails of sponsors they worked with in the past. If you ask nicely, most of the time they say yes as they expect that you will do the same for them.<br><br><br><br>#211. Once you have emails of potential sponsors, send them an initial message. Keep it short. To save you a lot of work, base your emails off of a template, but be sure to slightly personalize each message, because copy-paste emails are easily detectable and are frowned upon. In your email, tell briefly why you want this company to sponsor you. Don't tell them your rates just yet in case they can offer you more money than you ask.<br><br><br><br>#212. This is an example of an initial email. Replace the text in brackets with your information.<br><br>Hello<br>My name is [Robert Smith] and I'm reaching out for a collaboration inquiry.<br><br>I own the [Robert Smith Reviews] Youtube Channel, a [tech reviews] channel with [1056] subscribers averaging [300] views per video.<br><br>I would like to integrate [South VPN] into our next video through a [ad read] as my channel has a strong audience base that is interested in technology, and as my viewers trust my opinions and recommendations.<br><br>Please let me know if you are interested.<br><br>My channel link: https://www.youtube.com/@RobertSmithTechReviews<br><br>Regards,<br>Robert<br><br><br><br>#213. There are two main ways that companies work with YouTubers to advertise their products: ad reads and dedicated videos. Ad reads are when YouTubers quickly talk about a product for about 30-90 seconds in their video. Dedicated videos are when the product is featured throughout the entire video. Ad reads are easier, but some companies prefer dedicated videos.<br><br><br><br>#214. Once you have a response from a sponsor, it's time to write them a second email. First, thank them for their interest. Second, ask them for their rates. Once again, don't tell them your rates yet, even if they asked you about it in the email.<br><br><br><br>#215. It usually takes several emails back and forth until all the details are figured out. Some sponsors will send you a contract to sign. Some will only do it if you insist.<br><br><br><br>#216. Now it's time to create the sponsored video. Once it's ready, upload it to YouTube UNLISTED and send the link to the sponsor for review.<br><br><br><br>#217. Be sure to fix every issue they might have with the video and reupload the updated result also UNLISTED.<br><br><br><br>#218. Once you're given green light to upload, make the video public.<br><br><br><br>#219. Now it's time to get your money. Send the sponsor your PayPal info or whatever you agreed on for payment.<br><br><br><br>#220. When you include sponsored segments in your videos, you might see some dips in your viewership during those parts. This is normal and it's just something you have to accept as the cost of having sponsors.<br><br><br><br>#221. Don't say "yes" to every sponsor that comes your way, even if you are a very small youtuber.
<h3>Affiliate marketing</h3>
#94. Remember about affiliate marketing. With affiliate marketing, you can make money by promoting products or services in your videos. You tell about a product and put the affiliate link in the description to your video. When someone clicks on the link and makes a purchase, you earn a commission on the sale (usually 1 to 10 %). Start affiliate marketing early, even before your channel hits monetization. Actively search for companies having affiliate programs such as Amazon Associates (also Bass Pro Shops, Home Depot, Kohl’s, Nordstrom, Sephora, Target, Walmart).<br><br><br><br>#222. It's not a fast way to make money, but over time, it's a simple way to earn extra cash without doing much.<br><br><br><br>#223. Most popular affiliate marketing programs are: Amazon Associates, ShareASale, ClickBank. However, many companies behind some very well-known products and services have their own affiliate prgrams. Adobe, Epidemic Sound, Logitech, Unity Game Engine, just to name a few. Generalized programs such as Amazon or Clickbank offer a broad range of products for promotion, but in contrast, they have lower commission rates than specific programs.<br><br><br><br>#224. It's a good idea to choose products that you've actually used.<br><br><br><br>#225. When choosing products to promote, it's important to select ones with a high commission rate. Usually, products with a high markup, such as digital courses, ebooks, and luxury clothing, offer higher commissions.<br><br><br><br>#226. Usually, high markup products such as courses, ebooks, luxury clothing, laptops, smartphones offer higher affiliate commission.<br><br><br><br>#227. Be sure to put affiliate links in the description of your video.<br><br><br><br>#228. Some creators choose to go beyond just including affiliate links and actively promote products in their videos. While this can result in higher commission rates, it also requires more effort. Personally, if I feature a company in one of my videos, I prefer to be directly compensated through a brand deal.<br><br><br><br>#229. We can go beyond promoting affiliate links on videos. If you are active on other platforms, such as newsletters, blogs, Twitter, Instagram, or Discord servers, promote them there as well. You can also promote affiliate links during live streams.<br><br><br><br>#230. It's important to be honest with your audience by disclosing that you'll earn commission from the links in your description. This builds trust and ensures you follow FTC guidelines. The FTC requires social media influencers to clearly disclose paid endorsements or sponsorships in their content, and affiliate links are included in this category. Therefore, it's crucial to be cautious and transparent.<br><br><br><br>#231. For affiliate marketing, it's really helpful to have all your gear always in the background on your footage sitting on a shelf.<br><br><br><br>#232. The absolute minimum that you should do is specify in the description to your videos what gear (camera, microphone, lighting) you use as an affiliate link.<br><br><br><br>#233. Amazon doesn't only pay you when someone clicks on your link and buys a specific item. They also give you commissions for any purchases made on Amazon within 24 hours of clicking your link.<br><br><br><br>#234. You can easily update descriptions to hundreds of videos at once using TubeBuddy's find and replace tool. This allows to add or change links to your own website or Amazon Affiliate, among other things.<br><br><br><br>#235. Another helpful tip is to recommend free items on Amazon, such as Audible, which won't cost your audience anything. They can sign up for a free trial and keep the audio book forever, while you earn a $5 commission. There are also other programs on Amazon and other affiliate platforms that have $0 sign-up fees and offer bonuses and commissions. If someone signs up through your link and becomes a customer, you can earn even higher commissions.<br><br><br><br>#236. Comparing products, such as a $50 microphone versus a $500 microphone, can create engaging videos.<br><br><br><br>#237. One of the simplest ways to build credibility as an affiliate marketer is by promoting products that you personally use. Demonstrating these products through tutorials and reviews is particularly effective, as it allows your audience to see how the item works and how you use it in your daily life. When your viewers see that you are genuinely invested in a product, it helps to build trust and make them more likely to make a purchase.<br><br><br><br>#238. The best way to promote something is to base it on your own experiences and opinions.<br><br><br><br>#239. It's crucial to make it easy for your viewers to click on the specific affiliate links that you mention in your YouTube videos. While including them in the video description or verbally calling them out is helpful, it's not always the most convenient option. You can maximize engagement by making this link the pinned comment of your video, as this is the first thing that many viewers will see.<br><br><br><br>#240. Look for recurring affiliate programs.<br><br>A recurring affiliate program is a type of affiliate marketing program where affiliates receive commissions for every recurring payment made by the customer they referred to the product or service. This means that as long as the customer remains subscribed or continues to use the service, the affiliate will continue to receive a commission.<br><br>Recurring affiliate programs are good for affiliates because they provide a steady stream of income. Instead of relying on one-time commissions, recurring affiliate programs offer the opportunity for long-term passive income. Additionally, they can help build a loyal customer base, as customers are more likely to continue using a product or service that meets their needs over time. This means that recurring affiliate programs can be a win-win for both the affiliate and the company offering the program.<br><br>here are a few examples of recurring affiliate programs:<br><br>    Subscription-based services: Companies like Spotify, Netflix, and Amazon Prime offer recurring affiliate commissions to their partners for every user who signs up for a subscription through their referral link.<br><br>    Web hosting services: Many web hosting companies offer recurring affiliate commissions to their partners for every user who signs up for a hosting plan through their referral link.<br><br>    Health and wellness products: Companies that sell health and wellness products such as vitamin supplements or workout equipment often offer recurring affiliate commissions to their partners for every repeat purchase made by the customer.<br><br>    Online education platforms: Companies like Udemy and Skillshare offer recurring affiliate commissions to their partners for every user who signs up for their platform and remains an active subscriber.<br><br>    Software as a service (SaaS) products: Many SaaS companies offer recurring affiliate commissions to their partners for every user who signs up for their software and remains a paying customer. Examples of SaaS products include project management tools, email marketing software, and CRM systems.<br><br><br><br>#241. The easiest way to start making money with Audible is through their $5 flat fee free trial. You can recommend an audio book to people which they get to keep for free forever. You'll get a $5 commission for each person who signs up, and to make $100 you just need to refer 20 people who spend $0.<br><br><br><br><br>#242. TubeBuddy is a good example of recurring affiliate program.<br><br><br><br>#243. CJ (Commission Junction)
<h3>Merchandise</h3>
#244. When selling merch like T-Shirts, make their design less about you and more about your community. This in particular means that putting your face on them is not such a good idea. Instead, consider putting on it your channel's motto, something that both you and your audience believe in.<br><br><br><br>#245. Make professional, high-quality designs. You can find good and inexpensive designer on Fiverr.<br><br><br><br>#246. Promote your merch in your videos. If it's a T-Shirt, at the vey least wear it when filming yourself. But saying a few words about it will be even better.<br><br><br><br>#247. Before promoting your merchandise to your audience, obtain physical samples and use them yourself to ensure their quality matches your promotion. This personal inspection can help ensure that the merchandise lives up to the standard you advertise to your audience.<br><br><br>#248. Usually, you can earn around $5 to $8 on most print-on-demand items after subtracting the cost.<br><br><br><br>#249. Promote your merchandise by wearing it and discussing it in your videos.
<h3>CPM / RPM</h3>
#250. Your ad revenue is affected by where your viewers live. The highest YouTube CPM (cost per thousand impressions) rates tend to come from regions such as North America, Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. These regions typically have higher rates of advertising spending, which results in higher CPM rates.<br><br><br><br>#251. CPM and RPM are both terms used in digital advertising, but they measure different things.<br><br>CPM stands for "cost per thousand impressions." It is the amount that an advertiser pays for every 1,000 times their ad is shown to users on a platform. CPM is typically used to measure the cost of display and video ads, and it is calculated by dividing the total cost of the campaign by the number of impressions, and then multiplying by 1,000.<br><br>RPM stands for "revenue per thousand impressions." It is the amount of revenue a content creator earns for every 1,000 times their content is shown to users on a platform. RPM is typically used to measure the earnings potential of content creators on platforms like YouTube, and it is calculated by dividing the total revenue earned by the number of impressions, and then multiplying by 1,000.<br><br>In other words, CPM is a metric used by advertisers to measure the cost of ads, while RPM is a metric used by content creators to measure their earnings potential.<br><br><br><br>#252. CPM rates refer to how much advertisers pay for content per 1000 views. RPM, which you can see on your YouTube dashboard, shows how much money you make per 1000 views on your videos after YouTube takes their cut.<br><br><br><br>#253. CPM (Cost per thousand impressions) on YouTube can be influenced by several factors, including:<br><br>    Advertiser demand: When there are more advertisers willing to bid on ads, it drives up the cost of ad space, resulting in a higher CPM.<br><br>    Video content: Advertisers may pay more to place their ads on videos that are popular, high-quality, and relevant to their target audience.<br><br>    Target audience: Ads may be more expensive to target specific demographics or interests, such as age, gender, location, or interests.<br><br>    Ad format: Different ad formats have different CPM rates. For example, skippable ads tend to have a lower CPM than non-skippable ads.<br><br>    Time of year: CPM rates can vary depending on the time of year, with higher rates typically seen during the holiday season or major events.<br><br>    Ad placement: The placement of the ad within the video can also affect CPM. For example, ads placed at the beginning of a video tend to have a higher CPM than those placed at the end.<br><br>    Ad targeting: Ads that are targeted towards a specific topic, niche or industry tend to have a higher CPM than general ads.<br><br><br><br>#254. The CPM can change and may increase when more people advertise, especially during holidays and big events. Advertisers pay more during these times when there are more ads. Think about how many ads you see during Christmas season.
<h3>Brand deals</h3>
#255. If you're aiming for higher paid brand deals on YouTube, you need to prove your worth as a salesperson. One way to do this is by showing your audience's buying power. You can demonstrate this by showcasing your sales on your own products, like merchandise or digital services. For example, if you sell camera gear and use Amazon Affiliate sales, you can negotiate higher paying brand deals by proving your audience's interest in specific categories and affinity for the represented brands. By proving that your audience is willing to spend money on products, you can show potential sponsors that you have a buying audience.<br><br><br><br>#256. Always make sure to have a signed contract before entering any brand deals.<br><br><br><br>#257. Don't agree to any deal that gives the brand ownership of your content.<br><br><br><br>#258. Avoid brand deals that demand a specific number of views or need those views within a particular timeframe.<br><br><br><br>#259. Find brands in your niche that work with creators and make a list of the ones you want to work with.<br><br><br><br>#260. To work with a brand, you can try to find someone who works with them on Twitter or in marketing, or check their website for a PR page with a contact email.<br><br><br><br>#261. If you're a small content creator looking for brand deals, try using marketplaces like FameBit, Grapevine Logic, or IZEA. These are places where you can bid on brand deals, but be aware that some have requirements like a minimum number of followers or subscribers. The required numbers may vary, so you'll need to do some research to find out the specific requirements for each platform.<br><br><br><br>#262. Ask your youtuber friends about their rates.
<h2>Security</h2>
#263. My recommendation is to avoid sharing your Google account that controls your YouTube channel and AdSense. It's best not to use a public email account for this purpose and create a separate email address for business and contact purposes. Don't give out this email address publicly to avoid the risk of having your YouTube channel or AdSense stolen. Unfortunately, this happens often. By keeping your email address private, you can better protect your assets.<br><br><br><br>#264. Keep your YouTube channel email private and separate from any public contact information. If you have a business email listed in your About section, make sure it's different from your personal email. While managing multiple email accounts can be a hassle, it's necessary for security and protecting your content.<br><br><br><br>#265. Use a password manager with a strong, unreadable password generated by the program. Avoid using your own passwords. Consider using a password manager that allows you to have different passwords for each website. Some recommended password managers are Dashlane, LastPass, and 1Password. Although it may be inconvenient, it's essential to use a password manager to protect your security.<br><br><br><br>#266. Keep third-party access to your YouTube account to a minimum, especially when it comes to plugins and tools. Stick to using only the ones that are recommended by YouTube or trusted by the YouTube community. Avoid giving third-party accounts access to your channel.<br><br><br><br>#267. Don't share your phone carrier information with anyone, even if you buy a new phone. Keep it to yourself and don't disclose the phone carrier you're signed up with.<br><br><br><br>#268. To protect yourself from a SIM card swap request, you need to ask your provider to set up a security pass phrase. If you don't request it, there's a chance your provider won't require it and someone could impersonate you with basic information. Make sure to get the pass phrase notated in your account for added security. If you share a lot of personal information on your YouTube channel, hackers can use that to their advantage. They can use the "Forgot Password" option and trick the two-factor authentication process by getting the code on their own phone instead of yours. This is how they bypass the security measures and gain access to your account, ultimately locking you out.<br><br><br><br>#269. To protect yourself from hacking, you can consider getting a separate phone and number only for your social media and two-factor authentication. It's an extreme step, but if you can afford it, it's worth doing. Make sure nobody knows the number and use it only for these purposes. You should also limit the devices that have access to your YouTube channel.<br><br><br><br>#270. Try to avoid using public wifi as much as possible, especially when working on sensitive information. Although the pandemic quarantine makes it easier to avoid public wifi, some people still like to work at coffee shops or restaurants. However, minimizing public wifi usage can make you less vulnerable to potential security threats.<br><br><br><br>#271. Use antivirus software on your devices to protect yourself from potential threats. Even if you use Apple devices, it's a good idea to use antivirus software.<br><br><br><br>#272. Finally, there is another hardware option you can consider - a physical token. For YouTube and Google accounts, it's called the Google Titan Key. These keys require an investment, but there are other companies that make similar keys, such as UB. These keys are basically small fobs that you can use to physically unlock your device and access your Google account, providing an extra layer of security for your two-factor authentication. Google's Advanced Security allows you to set up this option. I'll link to some security resources in the description.<br><br><br><br>#273. Don't use a universal password for everything. Have a unique password for each service.<br><br><br><br>#274. When you receive emails from Google AdSense or YouTube, assume they are scams. Check your account first before opening any email, as they will usually contact you through the system first. Don't assume the email is legit, as scammers will use tricks like account termination, copyright claims, or invalid click activity to frighten you. You can identify scam emails by checking if the email address is from google.com. Google and YouTube don't require you to click on anything in these emails, and they never ask for your password.<br><br><br><br>#275. Don't link your other social media accounts to the same Gmail account you use for YouTube to avoid possible security breaches, because those ones can be compromised too.<br><br><br><br>#276. Don't use any browser plugins that aren't certified by YouTube. Stick with certified plugins like vidIQ, TubeBuddy, Social Blade, VideoAmigo, and Morningfame. These are the main ones that are trustworthy for YouTubers.<br><br><br><br>#277. If you receive an email about a sponsorship or brand deal, and they ask for access to your Youtube account through a link or click, avoid it.<br><br><br><br>#278. If you receive a sponsor email without a website or phone number, it's likely fake. If the first email asks you to click on something, it's probably a phishing scam. Clicking could give them access to your Google or YouTube account. So, don't click on it and avoid it completely. Smaller YouTubers are more likely to fall for this because they're excited to get their first brand deal, and scammers know it and use it to their advantage.<br><br><br><br>#279. Make sure that your "About" page doesn't show the email address linked to your YouTube account and Google AdSense. Otherwise scammers may use that information to target you.<br><br><br><br>#100. Check for viruses every file that you receive via email (that includes seemingly harmless files like images or documents). This helps you protect yourself and your channel from potential cyber threats and avoid the risk of losing valuable content or even your entire channel.
